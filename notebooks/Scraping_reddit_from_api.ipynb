It started off small, just a matching hairstyle and similar outfit. Nothing too strange. About two or three months ago, she started doing makeup the same way as me. Imagine thinking you\\'re alone when all of the sudden, you catch a glimpse of a pale face staring at you, eyes wide and lips parted as if dead or something.\\n\\nI screamed a bit and accidentally slammed the door shut, and Cynthia slinked into the room a minute later and apologized half-heartedly. She wanted a hug, but I was still shaken and turned her down a bit too rudely. I remember that she looked upset and stormed out, but I didn\\'t go after her. Later on, I drove her to the mall as my own apology, and I thought she had forgiven me. I should have known better.\\n\\nI woke up that night to her in my bed and wearing one of my nightgowns, and she had moved me to the floor. That was a bizarre experience, I won\\'t lie. When I tried waking her up, she told me, \"Go back to bed, (my nickname for her).\" Annoyed, I picked her up and dumped her onto her bed before slamming the door behind me. When I asked her about it the next morning, she just laughed it off and throw the tissue box at my head. (That\\'s a common occurrence).\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I walked into her room and found her sitting on the bed and staring at the door. Her eyes were blank, but they turned cold when she saw me. The strangest part was that it was like she didn\\'t recognize me anymore. Like I was an intruder and not her sister. She simply got up and passed by me without even saying anything, and I followed her to the dining room, more confused than ever.\\n\\nToday is where thing got really weird. She came home today with her hair dyed black, contacts that turned her eyes brown, and freckles painted on; when she said hi to me, I was surprised to hear her real voice. We\\'re Australian, but she\\'s always kept an American accent up for years. I don\\'t even know the reason why. (Our parents were also confused over her to-them-sudden-change FYI. I mean, she just came home and looked more like me then ever).\\n\\nHer personality has also changed. You\\'d think she would act more like me, right? Nope. She used to be so energetic and outgoing, always talking about the things she was interested in. However, she\\'s gone quiet and barely says anything. Most of it is mindlessly creepy. Just today, she asked me, \"Who would miss you if you went camping?\\n\\nThis weekend, I caught her about to leave the house, so I asked where she was going. She said that she was going to my friend\\'s house, and that D was expecting her. That confused me, so I checked my texts to see if I had missed something. Turns out, I had made plans to go over. I don\\'t know what C was thinking. Maybe she checked my phone and thought it would be a funny prank.\\n\\nI did mention this to my mother, who told me to go check the family scrapbooks. Since Christmas is tomorrow, I can look through them while waiting for dinner.\\n\\nAny help is appreciated, thanks. \\n\\n  \\nT.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 1}\n",

It will make you question everything, wish for a second chance, and do anything to get out of it. You have hope to start with. You pray, thinking that it matters once you\\'re down there, but eventually, all that gets burned away.\\n\\nThe only thing left of you then is the darkness that put you there. Over time, you begin to lose memories. You forget who you were, and you lose your humanity. It\\'s ripped away slowly, so you can feel it peeling off your soul, what\\'s left of it anyway.\\n\\nThe burning is intense. Indescribable. The best way it can be described is like a dry heat, like when you eat something spicy, but it makes you cough and burns your throat, mouth and nose, except you feel it all over, from the inside out. Everything burns away, and then slowly regenerates, so it can be burned again.\\n\\nSee, what they don\\'t tell you is that your soul has layers. Once one is peeled away by the blaze, another goes, until all that\\'s left is a tiny speck of what it used to be. Then it all comes back at once, and the slow burn starts over. There is no pain on Earth to describe it.\\n\\nIt\\'s a dark place, full of evil and despair. The flames don\\'t make any light, so you can\\'t really see much. It\\'s not that simple, though. You\\'d think the burning would be the worst part, but the most horrible thing isn\\'t what happens to you - it\\'s what you become willing to do to others, to save yourself. Then it\\'s an all different kind of Hell, where you wrestle with what it means to choose: between allowing yourself to burn, or being willing to cause more suffering to escape it.\\n\\nEveryone there is evil, in some form or another. They all ended up there for a reason, after all. Pedophiles, rapists, murderers, the worst of the worst of the worst. People who were truly awful when they were on Earth shouldn\\'t deserve any mercy, at least that\\'s what you think when you\\'re on this side of the dirt. The things you become willing to do, though, even to them - it will make you have empathy for even them.\\n\\nSee, I\\'ve been there. I barely even remember what happened to me before I was there. All I remember is it was some sort of wreck. One that I did not survive, at least not at first. You hear stories of near-death experiences (NDEs) all the time, and they usually sound so fleeting. Any time spent elsewhere, though, does not follow our rules of time. You can be there for the equivalent of centuries, and all that passes here is a quick moment.\\n\\nThe burning is awful, and I don\\'t know how long I was there. It could have been minutes, or it could have been several hundred years. What I remember is a group of people offering to get me out of it, and that Hell had more to it, that there was worse than the burning. They pulled me out of the fire, and offered me a choice: either stay in the pit and burn forever, or join them on their mission.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re made that kind of offer, you\\'d do anything to get out of the pit, no matter what it means, for you or anyone else. As soon as I was out of the fire, the relief was instant. I felt my soul begin to reform, and not burn away this time. I was immensely grateful, and willing to do anything if it meant that I got to stay whole. Of course, it\\'s easy to think that at first, but there was a catch. They explained to me that to stay out of the fire, we would have to catch those who somehow escaped it on their own, and punish them before sending them back. Otherwise, there was the risk that they could make it to Earth, and cause untold suffering on a level that we just can\\'t comprehend.\\n\\nThey summoned these motorcycles that were somehow alive, pulsating with bones, melted flesh and rotten crystals that smelled like smoke and sulphur. They were dressed like a biker gang; it was like they weren\\'t even trying to avoid the stereotype. They had apparently been there for thousands of our years, which down there, meant the equivalent to several hundred millenia.\\n\\nI explained that I felt too weak to do anything, even to stand, and that I needed to just rest. But they told me there is no rest in Hell. Either you do the work, or you burn. There were four of them in total: 3 men and 1 woman, at least that\\'s how I perceived them; but I believed them to actually be something far more sinister. One of them produced a small pill and instructed me to take it, that it would make me strong and give me the power I needed to do what had to be done, so I took it.\\n\\nI didn\\'t bother asking them why they saved me, why I was picked, or what it all meant. I didn\\'t care. Not yet. I rode on the back of one of the motorcycles with one of them, and we drove around what I can only describe as an empty, destroyed town, one that looked like it had been ravaged by war, flame and destruction. The sky was a hopeless white, and everything else was black and gray. The buildings were smoking and the roads were dilapidated. Plus, not to add to the stereotype again, but there were plenty of crossroads, each of which was guarded by a vile demon. If you stopped at one, they would catch you and throw you back in the pit, so it was crucial to keep moving.\\n\\nWe eventually came upon our first... target. He was a murderer, someone who killed children when he was alive, because he thought it was \"fun.\" Obviously, an evil man who deserved to be down there, to suffer for all eternity. One of the men showed me what they do: torture. He ripped him up from the ground where he was hiding, and did... awful things to him. Think of the worst thing you can imagine being done to someone, just the very worst thing. This was a thousand times as bad. There\\'s nothing in our world that can describe the torture being done. The tools they used, the methods, there are no words to describe it. People say that to make a point, but I mean there are literally no words to describe it because there is no Earthly equivalent. Sure, there were some things we\\'d recognize, like carving him up while he was conscious, peeling away the layers of his soul until all that was left was that speck, and then destroying the speck, but after that... well, it\\'s hard to describe. The speck would come back for a moment, and they\\'d capture it, putting it into a small pouch, which apparently contained its own pocket of Hell, one that was much deeper than the one we were in, and much worse. This other place wasn\\'t just burning, but a whole new level of terror. Demons would ravage the innards of those who were doomed to be there, eating them, and inside of those demons were further Hells, where each version got a little worse, so even if they climbed out again, they\\'d only be moving up to another Hell, too weak to try anything else. Then they\\'d get shoved down again even deeper than they were before.\\n\\nThese people seemed to enjoy what they did, laughing about it, hooting and hollering, cheering and feeling genuinely ecstatic about what they were doing. It unnerved me, because then, how were we any better? But I did not dare say this. I was too afraid, because I didn\\'t want to go back into the pit, or worse, go even further down. So, we just rode around, looking for more terrible souls who committed unspeakable acts of evil during their time.\\n\\nWhen we came upon the next one, it was my turn to practice what I had learned and observed. I don\\'t even remember what I did, and I don\\'t want to. The next thing I remember is shivering, shaking scared, being shocked at what I was capable of doing. The only other thing I remember before coming to was the begging and the pleading that this woman did, asking for forgiveness, truly repenting for what she had done, calling for God to help her, for me to save her or take her with us, anything to escape what was happening. But it\\'s like I couldn\\'t control myself. I continued, despite how I felt. When I was \"myself\" again, I felt a slew of guilt and regret that, again, has no comparison in our world. That in itself is its own kind of Hell.\\n\\nWe must have kept this up for decades there, until I finally couldn\\'t handle it anymore, and I wanted to stop. Once you\\'ve been out of the pit for a while, some semblance of your humanity begins to restore. I don\\'t know why it didn\\'t seem to for them, which is why I don\\'t think they were fully human, or human at all. I vocalized how I was feeling, and they became a whole new kind of angry. They seemed to feel betrayed and viscerally offended that I felt awful for what we were doing. Did those awful people deserve to suffer? Yes, of course, but I still felt awful. I still had a conscience somehow, like my humanity wasn\\'t fully gone. I was clinging to my old life somehow, memories beginning to return. The feelings of, \"what have I done?\" were overwhelming.\\n\\nSeeing this, they began to drag me back to the pit, tying me to the back of one of the motorcycles and driving off. That pain was almost as bad as the burning. Once we were back at the pit, I was terrified at first, but you\\'d be surprised at what you can get used to when you\\'ve experienced something far worse. I don\\'t think there\\'s a more fitting occasion than to say that sometimes, it\\'s better to stick with the devil you know, than to become one yourself.\\n\\nSo, I told them to go ahead. The things we were doing were so awful that I actually preferred to burn myself, than to cause suffering for others. I felt like I deserved it. It would be awful, and it would never, ever stop, but at least I wouldn\\'t be hurting anyone. I just wasn\\'t built for it. They picked me up, ready to throw me back in, but something happened.\\n\\nThere was a bright, white light, and the grace and peace I felt were... well, again, there\\'s nothing in our world to describe it. See, the thing is, if something that evil can exist, then the opposite must be true too. I felt so much love and forgiveness, and suddenly, I was awake in a hospital bed in the ICU. It wasn\\'t a great feeling, but by comparison to where I had just been, it felt downright heavenly.\\n\\nI prayed ceaselessly, asked for a Bible and began to read and study. I began to turn to God, not out of fear, but out of repentance. I like to think that the choice I made down there is what gave me another chance, and I don\\'t intend to waste it. So, heed my warning, while you still can: Hell is real, and it is so much worse than we think it is. What I saw was just a very small part of it, and more horrid things lurk down there that I didn\\'t get to witness. I hope I never have to again.\\n\\nThe thing that gets me through all the pain, suffering and aching of this life is the knowledge that if hate that strong can exist, then love of that strength can too, and that faith is the vehicle for love that will save us all.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 1}\n",

It wasn't much bigger than a walk-in closet, really, and the only way to fit two kids in there was with a bunk bed. I had the top bunk, my older sister, Sarah, had the bottom.\\n\\nSarah was always a sound sleeper. Like, *dead to the world* kind of sleep. I, on the other hand, was perpetually on high alert. Every creak of the old house, every rustle of leaves outside the window, had me wide-eyed, listening.\\n\\nOne of the earliest memories I have from that room, and it's burned into my brain like a brand, is the breathing. Not normal breathing, mind you. This was heavy, raspy, like someone was struggling for air. And it wasn't coming from Sarah.\\n\\nIt would start subtly, a faint wheezing sound that I'd initially dismiss as the wind. But then it would grow, becoming more distinct, more labored. It felt like it was right there, in the room with us, just below me. Sometimes, I could swear I felt the bed frame vibrate slightly with each ragged inhale.\\n\\nI tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was the pipes in the walls? Maybe it was just the house settling? But there was an undeniable organic quality to it. It sounded like a living thing, trapped and suffering.\\n\\nOf course, I’d try to wake Sarah. I’d nudge her, whisper her name, even gently shake her. Nothing. She’d just mumble and roll over, completely oblivious to the monstrous breathing that filled our tiny room. I was utterly alone with it.\\n\\nThis happened sporadically for years, seemingly without any pattern. Some nights were silent, blessedly so. Others, the breathing would start as soon as the lights went out and wouldn't stop until just before dawn. I’d lie there, stiff with fear, staring into the darkness, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. Was it under the bed? Inside the walls? Was it… *closer*?\\n\\nAs I got older, I started sleeping with a flashlight under my pillow. A few times, when the breathing was particularly intense, I’d flick it on, desperately scanning the room. Nothing. Just our clothes hanging in the cramped closet, the shadows stretching and distorting familiar shapes. But the breathing would still be there, mocking my futile search.\\n\\nEventually, we moved. I got my own room, a much larger one, thankfully. The breathing stopped. I started to forget about it, chalking it up to an overactive childhood imagination fueled by too many scary stories.\\n\\nUntil a few weeks ago.\\n\\nI was visiting my parents. My old room had been converted into a guest room, but the bunk bed was still there, disassembled and leaning against one wall, covered in a dusty sheet. I was helping my dad carry some boxes up the stairs when I saw it.\\n\\nNot the bunk bed itself, but something underneath it. Or rather, the *impression* of something underneath it. The dust on the floor beneath where the bottom bunk would have been was disturbed, almost like something had been dragged in and out repeatedly. There were faint, almost imperceptible trails leading towards the wall.\\n\\nMy dad noticed me staring. “Oh, yeah,” he said casually, “we had a bit of a pest problem in that room for a while. Nothing serious, just some… well, we never quite figured out *what* it was. Exterminator came, laid down some traps. Seemed to do the trick.”\\n\\nHe continued talking, something about needing to clean out the gutters, but I wasn’t listening. My eyes were fixed on the dusty floor, my heart pounding in my chest.\\n\\nPest problem. Traps.\\n\\nSuddenly, the heavy, raspy breathing echoed in my memory with chilling clarity. It wasn't coming *from* the bed. It was coming *from under* it. From whatever had been living, or perhaps *hiding*, in that confined space beneath my sister's bunk, just inches below me for all those years.\\n\\nAnd the trails leading to the wall… where did they go? Into the wall cavity? Did whatever it was just… *live* in the walls? Was it still there, somewhere in the house, unseen, unheard… waiting?\\n\\nMy parents have lived in that house for thirty years. I slept in that room for over a decade. And all that time, there might have been something else there, sharing the space, breathing in the dark, its presence a silent, terrifying secret just beneath the surface of our normal lives.\\n\\nNow, every time I think about visiting them, I get this cold knot of dread in my stomach. I picture that dusty floor, those faint trails leading into the unknown. And I can't shake the feeling that whatever it was, whatever *breathed* under my sister’s bed, might still be there, just out of sight, waiting for the lights to go out. And I wonder if the traps really got it all. Or if some things… some things just find another way in.\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 4}\n",

She sat at the kitchen counter overlooking the living room, her phone hanging dryly off her hand.\\xa0 Perry, our light blue terrier was resting his greying chin on my lap. His ears twitched slightly at his name, but his eyes did not open.\\n\\n I had been watching the new \"*The Penguin*\" show on MAX and had barely been listening.\\xa0\\n\\n\"What.\" I mumbled under my breathe. I could hear ma roll her eyes.\\xa0\\n\\n\"The Stevensons\\' dog went missing last night, they posted about it in the Hoodwatch page. Third one this week.\" she exposited ominously.\\xa0\\n\\n\"I wish you would stay off that page ma, it\\'s nothing but bored housewives tattling on each other.\" I complained back.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\"You\\'re just mad Mrs. Ray caught you smoking that \"jay.\" out in the yard.\" She protested back. She had whispered the word \"jay\" like it was a secret curse word, like she\\'d get in trouble for even thinking about pot. \"I still want you to take the taser with you\\'re walking around at night.\"\\n\\n She was referring to the little pocket taser she had gotten me for my 13^(th)\\xa0birthday. \\xa0I would barely call it a taser, more like a mini cattle prod that gave you a little jolt when jammed into some weirdo\\'s thigh. In high school I would sometimes creep behind my guy friends and jab them with it while yelling \" I DO NOT CONSENT.\" They did not find it nearly as funny as I did.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Perry is practically glued to me while I walk him, I don\\'t think I\\'ll need it.\"\\xa0I shrugged off her concern and went back to watching the great Oz Cobb conquer all crime in Gotham.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Well, what if it\\'s some coyote or rabid animal going after these poor creatures, if they get hungry enough, they\\'ll go after anything.\" She warned, my mother the oracle. \"What if it\\'s not an animal, what if it\\'s some sex pest kidnapping these poor creatures for nefarious purposes.\" She was clutching those pearls so hard they might turn into diamonds.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Sex pest.\" I repeated to the air.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, I read an article once, where they kidnapped a dolphin and feed him LSD and did all sorts of things to that poor animal.\" She whispered \"LSD\" like she would get into trouble if someone heard. She then went on to explain in graphic detail about what happened to the dolphin as I tuned her out, petting Perry and trying to watch TV. Just another average day on my summer break.\\n\\nI go to college in some mountain town up in Maine, but for the summer of my senior year I decided to stay with my mom. She had moved to some dead-end town in the boonies of New Hampshire to \"Stay closer\" to me. She had always been like this, ever since dad passed. I was only seven when he did, but I still vividly remember his hazel blue eyes and the smile that would be bright enough to power the eastern seaboard. Mom rarely smiled. Still doesn\\'t she just borrows her head in that stupid phone. Every day its some new conspiracy or horror with her.\\xa0\\n\\n\"California is going to collapse into the sea in the next two years Abbey, just you wait.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\"The Chinese are going to EMP us any day now.\"\\n\\n\"We never landed on the moon; Spielberg shot it in a day.\"\\xa0\\n\\nI never have the heart to tell her she\\'s double wrong on that one. But it\\'s always something with her. The other day she was telling me a circus train derailed 15 miles out of town. Bunch of animals got lose, lions and tigers and bears oh my. I don\\'t even know what crackpot site she found that one on, couldn\\'t find it on the news anywhere. When I told her that she just sort of chuckled in a \"Well why would you.\" sort of knowing way. I swear, she thinks she\\'s crackpot columbo.\\xa0It had been about three weeks of staying at her nice little suburban home, and two weeks since the animals started vanishing. There hadn\\'t been any bodies found, but sometimes there would be little specks of blood and fur next to a broken chain. Sometimes you could hear barking, quickly followed by a sharp yelp. I\\'ll be the first to admit it was kind of spooky, but I was a big girl, I could handle any sort of coyote. Espeacly with Perry on my side. Ausie cattle dogs are tougher than they look, even if they are sort of chunky looking. Almost like more muscular corgis. But they are gritty and grumpy all the same. While I did believe ma to be a nut, I had been walking Perry as close to dusk as possible. Maybe that was overly cautious of me, maybe it wasn\\'t.\\xa0Of course, tonight would be the night Perry woke me up at 2am. Tonight, would be the night the stalking began.\\xa0\\n\\nColin Farrell was whisking me away in a purple Lambo in the heart of Gotham City, his disgusting yet charming Penguin make up in full effect. I was dressed in a classic mid 20\\'s gala outfit, looking like Bonnie on her deathbed. I could hear colin mumbling in his powerful accent, how this city was ours and nothing could change that. I rubbed his burly shoulders, and expected him to turn to me with that wonderful smoldering look. Instead, when he turned his head, all I saw was my dog\\'s giant furry face, panting and whining at me.\\xa0\\n\\nI awoke to the sound of his eager whines and his ice-cold nose bopping my forehead. It was dimly lit in my room, a red mood light buzzed in an outlet in the far wall. I could see his beautiful crystal blue eyes both begging and apologizing at the same time. I turned over on my back and sighed. Perry continued his little back leg dance that singled his victory over me. I sat up and noticed myself in the mirror facing my bed. It was one of those big wall mirrors that basic bitch girls had, it was one of the few basic bitch commodities that I allowed myself. My curly red hair was matted and all over the place, my pale skin had somehow become paler. The black pentagram shirt I was wearing was about three sizes too big, and my stereotypical cookie monster PJ pants had, ironically, some cookie crumbs on them. \\n\\n*When had I even eaten cookies in bed*, I found myself wondering. I wasn\\'t that big of a slob. I brushed that thought off and took one last glance at myself and decided with confidence: I can go out looking like this.\\xa0For a late July night, I remember it being sort of chilly out. Lucky for Perry he had always been fairly shaggy for his breed. I on the other hand, was pretty stupid and decided I didn\\'t need a jacket. So, while Perry strolled merrily own our street, I was one step below freezing to death.\\xa0 Our long street was, well long. It was a side street off route five, and even at this late hour I could hear rumbling down the way. Perry was unbothered, however. We lived in a semi wooded area, like someone placed suburbia smackdown in the middle of Bambi\\'s birthplace. Occasionally I would almost splatter a squirrel or a deer running across the street. Route five was constantly littered with the squashed dead. One time I even saw a family of raccoons laid out, even the little babies.\\xa0 Rules of nature, I suppose.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nI always walked Perry to the end of our street and back, takes about twenty minutes all together. Perry was all business, such a good dog. We had gotten him when I was 14, to help protect myself when I was out late at night on my runs. One of ma\\'s better paranoid ideas. How old was he now? Seven, maybe eight? How long did cattle dogs- I quickly brushed THAT thought off and refocused myself on freezing to death. I was so focused on that I didn\\'t notice the leash had gone limp. I felt a rough tug and looked behind me. Perry was sitting calmly on the barely paved walkway. He had this look on his face, almost quizzical.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Pear bear. Wassa matter buddy.\" I quietly knelt down and scratched his chin. I noticed he was shaking a Little in his front legs. Thats when I heard a rustle in the bushes behind me. \\n\\n*\"Err, it\\'s right behind me, isn\\'t it?\"* Flash banged in my rotted brain. My heart spun in my chest as I looked at the bushes. There was nothing now but something had scuttered by. I was sure of it. In the distance I heard something small and furry screech out. It was a high-pitched whine, like a hamster being stepped on. For all I knew, maybe that was what\\'s was happening. The screech cut out as quickly as it began, and my blood ran cold.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Come on Perry, psst-psst come on buddy\" I calmly commanded to him. He was slow to budge at first, his glare still steadily trained on the tree line. I was about to pick him up when I heard a low growl. It was vicious and angry, and it was coming from Perry. The bushes rustled once more, more aggressive this time. Like something was contemplating jumping out. I stood there frozen and watched them, ready to scoop up Perry and book its back to the perceived safety of my mom\\'s house. That\\'s when I heard it.\\n\\n\\xa0*Hehheh, heheh, heheheh*\\n\\nA sinister giggle, mixed in with some sort of sharp barking. Thats the best way I can describe what I heard. It was like something was trying to mimic a human, but not really. It was an unnatural-natural imitation. If that makes any sense. Whatever it was sounded ghoulish, that\\'s for sure. The bushes rustled again and Perry stood up, his hair standing up as well. That growl became a snarl, deeper and more determined. This is the same dog who used to let rabbits chase HIM for fun.\\n\\n\\xa0\"P-perry COME.\" I commanded more harshly. I jerked his leash, and he snapped back to reality long enough to look back and cough at me, like I was strangling him to death. \"Perry come.\" I tried to keep my voice even and authoritative, but he could sense the tension in my voice.\\xa0 He was always good at that. He abruptly stopped his growl and retreated to my legs, a small whine. He started bopping my knees, trying to herd me along home. I could feel his sloppy Tounge grace my palm and felt his eyes look up at me for approval.\\xa0\"Good boy.\" I muttered as I started backwards towards home. Couldn\\'t take my eyes off the bushes. I heard that low cackle again and me and Perry won a gold medal sprinting back home. I slammed the door shut behind us and triple locked it.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Whatta ya slamming doors for Abbey Mae Lee.\" I heard ma call out. I Ignored her and collapsed onto the nearest kitchen chair. Perry jumped into my lap and settled in almost immediately. He wiggled his rear end into my hand and demanded pats. I obliged; it comforted us both. \\n\\nTwo days later they found the first body. \\n\\nI had kept what I heard to myself; ma already had sort of a reputation with the neighbors. Didn\\'t need no whispered looks aimed at me. I was out for my morning jog when I saw a small crowd gathered on the front lawn of a house three doors from me. It belonged to the Raymonds. They were always nice to me. Nice enough to ma. I could hear Norma Raymond wailing while Pat held her close. Neither of them could bear to look at what the crowd was gawking at. I could hear uncomfortable murmurs as I approached. The group silently opened up to let me in as well.\\xa0It was their Chocolate Lab. Iggy. He had been split open down the middle, and what was left of his organs had been chewed up, one might say ravenously. Something had torn away at his back; deep claw marks crowded it. It looked like they had used his spine for a scratching post. Iggy\\'s once green eyes were now glassy, and he reeked of rot and manure. I saw someone point to the house and noticed a giant bloody splotch, like something had thrown Iggy against the house. I squinted my eyes and saw a dent where the blood was most thick. Finally, I saw the bloody trail that led to poor Iggy\\'s final resting place. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t believe my eyes, and part of me felt like throwing up then and there. The other part of me was beyond curious about what could have done this. I quietly listened to the panicked populace.\\n\\n\"Kinda sick freak--a wolf or something-\\n\\nGottta call AC, they\\'ll get down here-\\n\\nIt was clearly a Hyena you dolt.\"\\n\\nThat last voice struck me in the ear like a hammer to the head. I turned to see my mother in her pink bathrobe arguing with a splinter group of neighbors They were Cleary trying to usher her away from the scene. I snuck over there, trying to eavesdrop.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Miss Lee please. You\\'re upsetting Norma even more.\" I heard one guy say. He was a bald man with a giant red bush growing on his face. Ma just wagged her finger at him.\\n\\n\"Look at the way he\\'s cut. Down the middle, like an incision. It was precise, it was deliberate, no other animal hunt like that.\" Ma was determined I give her that. The small crowd shifted uncomfortably, as you would do when talking to an insane person. Another voice protested, in a hush whisper.\\n\\n\"Tracey that\\'s nuts. How would an animal like that even come around here-\" The voice of reason began but was quickly cut off by the rambling of a mad woman.\\xa0\\n\\n\"It came off that circus train that derailed few weeks back. They never found all of them animals. I read about these creatures; opportunistic carnivores that feed off the dead mostly but hunt when they can. They are also territorial to boot.\" She jerked her thumb over to the bloody side of the house. More groans and curses followed. I held my breathe as I walked over to my mom, gently taking her hand.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Ma why don\\'t we go home.\" I said gently. \"We can watch some Kolchaks or something.\" I started to guide her out as the crowd parted ways. Ma mumbled about how she knew she was right, but she\\'d humor me because she knew how much I liked that show. I tried to ignore the murmurs as we walked away. I tried. Redbeard said \"Crazy old bitch.\" and a few others agreed. The voice of reason tried to calm them, saying it wasn\\'t ma\\'s fault, she was cooped up all day with her batty dau-\\n\\nhmmm Maybe he wasn\\'t the voice of reason Afterall.\\xa0\\n\\nAs crazy as it sounded however, that was the start of the Hyena rumors. It was also the start of when I would hear rustling around the yard at night and dawn. When Perry would spend hours at a time just staring out the window. I could often her him growling late into the evening. Even when I walked him in the afternoon, he wasn\\'t the same. He was slow, almost too cautious. The wind would move through the tree branches and he would dead stop. After a few days he even had me doing it. If you listened closely at night, you could even hear that ghoulish heckle. It would go off and on in the night, sometimes devolve into howls, like a mad man ranting at the moon. It wasn\\'t long after Iggy that more bodies turned up. Some fresh kills, others discovered just outside the trails to the woods. All were found in various states of mangle and decay. What was left of the pet population went into hiding. Once friendly cats and pups would bark and snap at the slightest provocation. Others on our street started to report the heckling in the night. \\n\\nRedbeard, who it turns out lived across the street from us, claimed he saw something one night. It was leering over a deer, loudly gulping down its meal. All he saw was a massive four-legged figure with a hunched back. He must have gasped loudly or something because the creature had heard him. He said it turned towards him, meat and viscera spilling out of its maw. He said it had pure white eyes, glowing in the evening sky. It began to heckle at him, and Redbeard ran inside like the coward he was. \\n\\nThat didn\\'t help the hyena rumors I tell ya Hwhat.\\xa0\\n\\nThere were two really bizarre things about all this. I had looked into the train derailment, just to ease my own piece of mind. It had not been a circus train; it had actually been a train bound for Cavier Park Zoo in Maine.\\xa0 Supposedly some animals had gotten loose, but there was no mention of any sort of dangerous animal or something like that. I had tried to find the zoo so I could contact them, again jus for my own peace of mind.\\n\\n I could find no such place and the train derailment story itself was buried in the headlines. No clue what that could have meant. Ma would scream coverup so I kept that from her.\\xa0The second fucked up thing is it seemed the authorities had abandoned us. Animal control came out once, picked up some bodies and never came back. Deputy Soso had come by one night after Someone called about heckling and scratching at the door. He had gone around back and found scratch marks on the door but no animal. He also never came back. Maybe I\\'ve been around my mother too much, but something stunk around here.\\n\\nThis went on for a few more nights, until August 28th. I\\'ll never forget that night.\\xa0On the 27th, I had heard a massive crashing sound like glass breaking. Then I heard Redbeard screaming.\\xa0In the morning, there was a group outside his house. His front door had been busted open; trails of blood littered the yard. Like he had been dragged away into the woods. We never did find the body, even after the fact. There was an uproar of course, and the cops finally came back. They issued a strict curfew for that night and posted two cars down the road. Tomorrow morning, animal control would be coming, and they would not leave until they caught the heckling beast. \\n\\nMa locked herself in her room that night, refused to even talk to me. I on the other hand posted up in the living room with Perry. He had been on high alert all week. He snuggled next to me on the couch while I nervously fiddled with the taser pen. I had no idea if it even still worked. The only light was the dim hue of Dexter, filling my mind with ease. That easiness did not last of course. The heckling began around 11pm. It was distant at first. Then it got closer, closer and closer until I swear, I could hear it ringing in my head like a godforsaken bell. Then the scratching began. It was piercing, like nine-inch nails on a chalkboard. I shot straight up, as did Perry. It was coming from our back door. It wasn\\'t aggressive, at first. It pawed on the glass like a friendly neighbor asking for some sugar.\\n\\n I tiptoed to the back and saw the outside tracking light had been turned on. I Could barely make out the creature behind the glass. It was silhouetted. But it was huge. It had two massive front paws, and a massive hunched back, it sat like a gargoyle perched on its step. I could make out a long, flowing black mane, like a horse. God help me, I could see those glowing white eyes looking right at me. It spotted me gawking and opened its jaw, letting out a massive heckle. Perry stood beside me, standing his ground like the brave little solider he was. The creature was absolutely giggling to itself now, like it had its own private joke.\\xa0 The stench of the thing was overwhelming, even from inside. It smelled like death, to put it lightly. The giggles subsided and gave way to a low snarl as it pursed its lips. I could see flashes of massive canines on a crimson stained maw.\\xa0\\n\\n I backed up slightly as Perry barked. With a single shove of its arm, it tore through our glass door like paper. I let out a yelp and aimed the taser pen at it, backing away. The Hyena, yes, I could see it more clearly now, was massive. As it began to further tear its way into our house, I could make out its Burgandy fur, covered in black spots. It was built like a lion, those paws. It had two long pointed ears; one was torn and ragged. Strangely the most unbelievable part was the worn leather collar around its neck. It was decayed slightly, and I could see bit of metal ticking out of it. There was also a nametag that clearly read: \\n\\n\"Spot\"\\n\\nSpot the hyena lurched into the house, mouth agape drooling all over the floor. Its big yet narrow gaze never left me, and I swear it was smiling at me. It slowly walked over, glass crunching under its paws. The stench was horrid at this point, like sulfur and rancid meat had a baby and named it Spot The hyena.\\xa0 Perry was beside me the whole time, barring his teeth and snarling right back at Spot. Spot looked like it was about to pounce, but then Perry leapt into action. He was in the air trying to tackle the beast in a blink of an eye. Spot simply swatted my 75-pound dog away, backhanding him into a wall. Perry slammed into it with a thud and instantly yelped. He collapsed to the ground and struggled to get back up, whining in pain and fear. Tears welled up in my own eyes but I didn\\'t back down from Spot. I held out the taser like a cross against Dracula.\\n\\n\"Come on then.\" I heard myself mutter. Spot pounced, I fell back and hit the ground, shattering my spine. Spot pinned me down and instantly went for my throat. Lucky for me my arm got in the way. His teeth cut into me like butter, gnawing at my forearm. A surge of pain and adrenaline hit me at once and instead of screaming I Jammed the taser pen in Spots\\'s ear with all my might.\\xa0It still worked. Spot yelped and laughed in pain. He jumped off me, sipping at my chest with his claws. He barely touched me, but my shirt was torn and I could see three red drips start to form on my stomach. I got up as quickly as I could, and almost passed out immediately. Spots mouth foamed with what I hope was just fury, and I readied myself for another strike.\\xa0Thats when I heard Perry bark with the force of a billion wolves. It caught Spot\\'s attention just long enough for me to strike first, jabbing him in the neck this time . Spot lurched back and Perry attacked from Spot\\'s blindside.\\n\\n It was a flurry of furry action then, both Spot and Perry locked in mortal combat. They rolled around on the ground, Perry latched onto the beast\\'s neck and Spot sinking his claws into Perry\\'s back. Despite all that Perry never yelped once. He stood his ground ripping at the thick neck of the hyena. I tried, I tried so hard to break them up, to save Perry. But I was knocked back onto the floor by their struggle. Blood covered our once gray tiles floor. I remember hoping most of it was from Spot. The two gladiators let go of each other for only a moment, and with a roar Perry pounced on the Hyena and tackled him through the broken door and onto the lawn. I lost track of them then as Spot started to limp away but Perry gave chase. I must have blacked out for only a moment. I came to and slowly collected myself. My back was killing me, a massive bite wound as already swelling on my arm. I couldn\\'t bear to look t my stomach. Only one thing concerned me at the moment. I made my way outside and called for Perry.\\n\\n I could hear commotion outside and people were rushing over to our house. Couple of them even had guns. I followed some spackles of blood loosely into my backyard and under the old oak wood giant laid both Spot and Perry. Spot laid silent under the giant, a vacant look in its eyes. His throat had been torn out, a feat only a good boy like Perry could do. Perry himself was only a couple feet away. Hi chest was moving erratic and he as panting nonstop, but he was alive. I limped over as fast as I could over to him, my voice hoarse with grief.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Perry-Perry-Perry its ok boy good boy you\\'re such a good boy.\" I knelt down beside him and inspected the damage. He was drenched in blood, several deep claw marks on his back and head. His eyes looked up at me and he pawed at me. I shushed him and held him close and patted his little head. It was all I could do to repay him. Tears hit Perry\\'s snout, and he licked them off my face as best he could. He was always thinking of me, even then. \\n\\nA crowd started to gather in my backyard, a siren wailed in the distance. People were pointing in awe of the massive creature Perry had vanquished. Inside my mother was yelling, complaining about what that racket was. I didn\\'t care about any of that. I just wanted Perry to be ok.\\n\\n\\xa0No one ever did get a clear answer on what the hyena was, or where it even came from. Animal control took the body, took some statements and we never heard back. Never even made the news, far as I can tell. Of course, conspiracy reigns on my street, with ma at the top of that shit heap. Most popular theory is that it escaped from a train bound for a government lab, some kind of super hyena. \\n\\nSecond most was it was the pet of some rich asshole up in the mountains, got lose and escaped. Ma claimed that we should be on the lookout for hybrids now.\\xa0\\n\\n\"It was out in the woods for god knows how long Abbey Mae. Probably slipped it into all sorts of creatures.\" My mother, the poet.\\xa0Of course, I knew that was a ridiculous thought. What, in a couple years there would be were-hyenas roaming the forest? It was laughable, I don\\'t even think they can crossbreed with anything out here. But then again, no one expected a hyena to be in New Hampshire. That last thought was always in the back of my mind. I came out of it ok, just some scars on my body and mind, what\\'s a few more. I became sort of a local hero in the neighborhood, both me and Perry.\\xa0\\n\\nPerry.\\xa0It was touch and go for a little while, but I finally got some news. Its why I\\'m posting this today. \\n\\nToday is the day I can finally bring him home and give him all the treats he deserves.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 1}\n",

His tail was trapped, and his lower body was immobile. He twisted about wildly from the waist, memories surging back.\\n\\nThe party last night had been wild- pufferfish, dolphins, seals, and then of course someone made the stupid suggestion to surface.\\n\\nThat was the last thing Coral actually remembered. The shock of the sudden cool breeze on his streaming wet face, the white moonlight bouncing off the heaving black waves. \\n\\nNow here he was, buried up the waist in sand, the terrible morning sun already striking impossibly bright rays from the sea into his eyes.\\n\\nHe tried to move his tail, but the weight of the sand over it was too much for more than the slightest twitches.\\n\\nCursing his friends who must have thought it hilarious to bury him on the beach and then leave him stranded, he started digging with his bare hands, removing fistfuls of sand from around his torso and scattering it feebly away from him. The night before had left him weak, and despite his muscular upper body and powerful swimmer’s arms, he was not making much progress. His fingers were becoming sore against the rough sand and sharp pieces of shellfish.\\n\\nAnd then he heard a seal- no- a dog barking.\\n\\nOh fuck.\\n\\nHe tried digging faster to free himself, but the dog was free and bounded up to Coral easily. Coral tried to move his tail again, but hampered by the great weight of sand piled over it, he was helpless.\\n\\nThe dog was big furry beast, and sniffed at him with interest, while Coral tried to twist away from its big wet black nose. He liked playing with seals generally, but now was not a good time. He frantically clawed at the tightly-packed wet sand, trying to free his long strong tail.\\n\\nJust as the pronged silver tip of his tail began to gleam through the dull sand, the human walked up. “Scrabble! Scrabble! What have you found boy?”\\n\\nScrabble leapt with delight between the pair of them, trying to get them to make friends.\\n\\nCoral made one last effort and heaved himself out of the hole, his very long steely-black tail curling and twitching around his smooth humanoid body. He lay panting, then slowly turned and locked eyes with the human, his fatigue giving way to the imperative of the ancient rule of the sea.\\n\\nScrabble barked urgently, his delight turning into fear at the deadly alien look in Coral’s cold greenish-pink eyes.\\n\\nRealising too late they had stumbled upon something not meant for us to see, the human gasped and turned.\\n\\nCoral easily reached out and wrapped his tail around the human, their efforts to free themself wholly futile. One of Coral’s translucent tail fins covered their face entirely, so they were silent and bound tight as Coral crawled on his hands rapidly back to the waves, dragging his prey behind him.\\n\\nScrabble barked.

It’s catchy, it stays in your head all day, and that part specifically is creepy. Come on I know some of you agree. It’s the holiday season and life is stressful. Work is always busy, there is always traffic, and getting all the gifts together to wrap is always a pain. BUT it’s all worth it every single time I see that smile and joy on my daughter’s face. She’s five now but ever since she got the concept of Christmas it’s her favorite time of the year. This year is no different, since Thanksgiving she has had her Christmas list ready and is adding things daily.\\n\\nAs the days wore on more and more decorations came out. Inflatables and lights in front of the house, stockings and the Christmas tree inside of the house. To our family this truly is the best time of the year. One of my daughter’s favorite thing to do was to go see Santa at the mall. She would bring her list and before the annual picture she would read off everything she wanted. This year was no different. List in hand my daughter went up to Santa, sat on his lap and then Santa asked that magical question.\\n\\n“Were you a good girl this year?”\\n\\n“Yes I sure was Santa. I ate all my veggies, I brushed my teeth, and I did ALL my homework.”\\n\\n“HO HO HO!! Good job! Santa will make sure you get everything you ask for!”\\n\\nAfter a smile and big hug my daughter ran over to me happy to tell me about the news from Santa. When we got home my daughter went on the hunt for my wife to tell her about what Santa had said. She couldn’t hold back the excitement. The last couple of years I had the idea to slowly add more  presents under the tree as Christmas got closer in order to build up the excitement. I explained to my daughter that because Santa had to visit all the little boys and girls all over the world he had to come back a few times to drop more presents off. I obviously would put the presents under the tree while she slept and each morning when she woke up she would try to see what new presents were under the tree. By the time Christmas came the living room was filled with presents.\\n\\nOn the night I laid out the first round of presents I was exhausted. Once I placed out a few I decided to call it a night and headed up the stairs to the bedroom. While laying in bed I was drifting off to sleep when I heard a creak on the stairs followed by the sound of something falling. I quickly stood up and headed for the door. I opened the door and to my surprise my daughter was at the top step with a flashlight in hand.\\n\\n“Honey what are you doing?”\\n\\n“I’m tryna see him daddy, I’m trying to see Santa!”\\n\\n“Oh jeez! I don’t think you’re gonna see him darling he drops the presents off before anyone can see.”\\n\\n“Oh no daddy I am gonna catch him! You’ll see!”\\n\\nI laughed and scooped her up to bring her back to her bedroom. I tucked her in and walked back to my  bedroom laughing to myself along the way at how funny she is. The next day was another exhausting day of work with some family time mixed in once I got home. Once we put our daughter down to sleep my second job began. More presents were added under the tree. This time as I was making my way back up the stairs I saw my daughter’s bedroom door crack open ever so slightly. I saw her little feet at the base of the door. I just shook my head with a slight chuckle.\\n\\n“Hey you!” I whispered “Time to get to bed, I just checked and Santa isn’t here.”\\n\\n“Oh come on Dad! I know he is coming!”\\n\\n“Bed please!”\\n\\nAnd with that she closed her door and I heard her shuffling back to bed. The next couple of days were rinse and repeat. Work, dinner, bed time, presents. Without fail, every night, I heard my daughter’s door open and footsteps in the hallway. My wife had convinced me to let it play out.\\n\\n“Just let her do it. She is having fun, I’m sure she will go to sleep once she doesn’t see anything.”\\n\\n“You’re right, she will just be excited to see more gifts under the tree.”\\n\\nIt was now Christmas Eve and the tree was almost fully surrounded by presents at least a foot high. After my nightly routine I peaked into my daughter’s room to make sure she was sound asleep and she was. I made my way back to my room and climbed in bed. I was waiting to hear her door and  footsteps in the hallway like every night but this time all I heard was the sound of my wife snoring. I thought maybe she finally realized she wasn’t going to “catch” Santa. To be honest it made me a little sad. I thought it was adorable and it really showed how innocent she was. The night went on and I didn’t hear a peep from her room. When she woke up I had breakfast made.\\n\\n“No luck with Santa last night?”\\n\\nShe had a huge smile on her face. “Oh I saw him Daddy, I saw SANTA!!!”\\n\\nI was curious to where this was going so I played along. “Oh did you now?!”\\n\\n“I sure did, he came to my room and asked if I was a good little girl this year.”\\n\\nWell that was kind of creepy.\\n\\n“I told him I was and he told meeeee that if I wanted to get even more presents that I should stay in bed and stop trying to catch him.”\\n\\n“Oh, okay honey, that’s good.”\\n\\nAlright that is extremely strange. What an odd imagination my daughter had, I thought. Maybe she saw me putting the gifts under the tree and didn’t want to ruin the “magic” of Christmas so she made up this whacky story. That has to be it. I went to work that day and the image of “Santa” in my daughter’s room stayed with me. By the time I got home I was pooped. I only had a few more presents to put out and Christmas was tomorrow. I figured once my daughter went to sleep I would put out the last presents, set up a plate with cookies and milk, and then take my exhausted self to bed. To say I knocked out was an understatement. The long days have caught up to me and they were starting to take a toll. It was going to be all over soon and well worth it.\\n\\nMy daughter came sprinting in our room on Christmas morning.\\n\\n“MOMMY, DADDY!!! WAKE UP!! IT’S CHRISTMAS!!!”\\n\\n“I’m up! I’m up!” I shouted.\\n\\nShe ran down the stairs and we followed close behind. She was ecstatic and could not wait to open her presents. I told her she could start with whatever present she wanted. Before I could finish the sentence she was already ripping wrapping paper off the biggest one. In all the excitement I looked around the room and noticed that the cookies that I had placed out were all gone and the glass of milk was empty but toppled over. I thought to myself that my wife had gone to extra mile to make it more believable.\\n\\n“Nice touch babe”\\n\\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\\n\\n“The cookies and the milk. She is definitely gonna think Santa devoured that.”\\n\\n“Uhhh I didn’t do anything.” She said with a nervous laugh. “I figured that was you. Along with these boot prints that you left on the floor.”\\n\\nI wasn’t wearing boots. I was too tired last night to do any of the “extra” stuff. Did our daughter eat the cookies? I mean maybe but that wouldn’t explain the boot prints. That’s when I saw it. A gift that didn’t look familiar. A gift that I hadn’t put under the tree. Eloquently wrapped with a big bow and tag on it. I walked over to it and looked at the tag. The tag read “To the good little girl.” What the hell is this? I sat down on the floor and began to unwrap it.\\n\\n“Hey daddy, that’s not yours!” My daughter yelled.\\n\\nI continued to unwrap it. I lifted the lid of the box. Inside there were pictures. Dozens and dozens of pictures. Pictures of us sleeping, of my daughter sleeping, pictures of us leaving the house. “What the fuck is this?” Pictures of us at the mall, my daughter sitting on Santa’s lap. There was a note at the bottom of the box.\\n\\n“Thank you for being such a good girl. I’ve been watching you to make sure you weren’t lying. I hope you like the presents I left. Love Santa”\\n\\nI stood up, pictures falling all over the floor. I heard my daughter laugh with excitement.\\n\\n“Ohhhh I love it daddy! This is my favorite teddy bear ever! It even sings a song!”\\n\\nMy daughter gave the bear a squeeze.\\n\\n“He sees you when you’re sleeping, he knows when you’re awake, he knows if you’ve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake.”', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 8}\n",

We were all teenagers, all 16 except for dylan who was younger then us he was 14. Luke was the only one with a car so we would spend the whole day driving around in his car going random places like teenagers with new found freedom do. We went to the mall and walked around daring each other to talk to girls and messing around with displays and window shopping. Then ended the evening with beefy 5 layers at taco bell. As the night came to a close we all sat in Dylans room talking about what we wanted to do and how we should spend the summer.  \\n“Have you guys ever heard of Kelly road?” Said Garry  \\n“Yeah that junkyard, the guy that owns that place is crazy and threw a rock at someones car before, Im not driving there.” Luke lazily muttered, staring at the ceiling laying in bed.  \\n“Well we should do something tonight, its such a nice day.” I said.  \\n“What about Prim Rose?” Dylan said menacingly.  \\n“Whats that?” Luke sat up interested in some place new.  \\n“I dunno, its this road I heard about out in the woods…. Suppose to be hunted or something” Dylan said while looking at maps on his computer “I know how to get there, its only like 30 minutes away off the bypass.”\\n\\n“Hunted? That’s stupid what is suppose to be there ghost?” Gary scoffed\\n\\n“Supposedly there used to be an old church out there, they say cult stuff happen out there, and I read about something called Blood Rock, a rock where someone’s baby drowned at”\\n\\n“Sounds spooky we should go at midnight make it scary oohhhh”  \\nWe all gathered around the pc looking at mapquest, looking over how to get there and continued joking about what we would do when we got there.\\n\\nAs Midnight approached we all piled into lukes red camaro, it only had two doors so two of us had to squeeze in the back. We brought a flash light, a camera, and a can of mace. Never know, might come in handy. We sped down the highway as we left the city and headed out into a increasingly sparsely populated \\xa0area. \\xa0Along the highway it turned into just trees and a street light here and there, the darkness hung down like a dark curtain, it was a very dark night. As you turn off the highway we passed by an old gas station that looked like it had been out of service for years, at the light there was a couple farm houses. We took a left and drove down a long winding road with trees on either side and a house every so often. The road took a long wide left turn then went up a long hill, so large you couldn’t see up ahead  \\n“I think we are here, it is the next left turn..” Dylan quietly said, turning down the radio and eyes wide peering out the windows.\\n\\nAs we came to the crest of the hill we saw an old dingy yellow arrow sign with bullet holes in it pointing left and right. To the right it led to an open road with wide open corn fields on either side and a farm house off in the distance. To the left was a fierce sum sight. Prim rose road in all its glory. The road was surrounded by thick woods that hung around the road in a perfect tunnel shape, it looked like the woods was attempting to swallow the gravel road. It was a straight hill down into darkness, so dark all we could see in the car headlights were the gnarled twisting trees that were so thick you could barely see the sky. The foliage on the ground was even thick. Living in Indiana seeing untamed woods was pretty normal but this seemed different, it seemed jungle like, unwelcoming. The sudden sight of the trees strangling out the sky above was jarring.\\n\\n“Wow, that is a creepy ass road!” Gary exclaimed from the backseat.  \\n“Man I don’t know about this, I didn’t know it was a dirt road I don’t-“ Luke said but was cut off by boos from the rest of us. “Come on man we are already here, lets at least drive down it once” I said.  \\n\\xa0Attached are photos during the day, even during the day the sight is unsettling.\\n\\n\\xa0[https://ibb.co/j6xSt9X](https://ibb.co/j6xSt9X)\\n\\n\\xa0[https://ibb.co/JxQ3t9Q](https://ibb.co/JxQ3t9Q)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Well you guys ready?” Luke yelled as he peeled off drifting around the corner. The sudden take off was exilerating and we all laughed with glee, as teenagers with no regard for safety. We got about ten feet into the gravel road when suddenly we were all blinded by headlights.  \\n“OH SHIT” Luke whipped the car to the side as a old white chevy truck came flying past us, going so fast we didn’t even see the occupants or even see it as it passed us and disappeared in the nights dark embrace in our mirrors.  \\n“holy shit what the fuck was that dude??”I said\\n\\n“I don’t know I didn’t even see them I swear to god, what the fuck was that idiot doing” Luke gasped\\n\\n“I didn’t even see them, they must have been checking out prim rose too” Dylan said grimly.\\n\\nAfter a silence Gary exclaimed “Fucking pussies” We all laughed nervously.\\n\\n“Turn your brights on lets see whats ahead.” I said.  \\nLuke flipped the brights on, the long gravel road seemed to snake on forever, with the trees never breaking for the moonlight to shine through. The headlights seemed like two long white poles piercing through the darkness. The road went down a hill then snaked to the right at the bottom of the hill about 70 yards a head of us. Luke slowly put the car into gear and let it idle down the hill while we all scanned the deep woods surrounding us, taking turns pointlessly shining the flashlight into the unwavering darkness. After the truck almost hit us we were all on a swivel looking for anything moving.  \\n\\xa0“Doesn’t seem that scary just some woods..” Dylan said smugly.\\n\\nThe gravel crackled under the tires and the sound seemed to bounce around the darkness, we the windows down except for Luke he refused to roll his window down more then a crack. Being in the back seat of a two door Gary and I had to crane our heads over the shoulders of the front seats to see out. As the car slowly rolled along we reached the bottom of the hill and the road started its long turn right. Another picture of the road.\\n\\n[https://ibb.co/n697HZX](https://ibb.co/n697HZX)\\n\\n“Lets get out and Look around.” I said\\n\\n“No way dude Im not getting hit” Luke said nervously.  \\n“Come on dude don’t be scared, want me to hold your hand” Gary said as he pushed the seat release and pushed his way out the door. Gary and I stepped out of the car almost instantly feeling small and realizing how dark it was being out of the safety of the car.\\n\\n“Wow This is Definity the sticks.” I said shining the flashlight into the woods and looking above us to only see trees.\\n\\n“Yeah heh” Gary said from the other side of the car, also feeling suddenly not so brave in the darkness.  \\n“So since you guys are so brave hope you are ready” Yelled Luke. Before I knew it he peeled out again taking off down the road. Suddenly leaving Gary and I in the dark.  \\n“FUCKING ASSHOLE!” Gary screamed running after him\\n\\nLuke even turned the car lights off to scare us even more and it worked. My flashlight seemed so much smaller without the lights of the car illuminating the area around us.\\n\\nGary and I took off running after the car as I ran next to Gary I grabbed him and tried to pull him into the woods just messing around.  \\n“STOP IT DUDE” He gasped while running.  \\nI laughed and got an idea, I ran as fast as I could into the woods. I was always athletic and could run very fast. I felt confident that I could out run any shadows here. I could hear Gary yell for me as I jumped into the woods and ran through the darkness as fast as I could, keeping the flashlight trained on the ground so I didn’t fall. The woods were very deep, till they suddenly weren’t. I ran about 20 yards into the right of the road into the woods to suddenly jump out the foliage into a large clearing. I stopped for a second and swang the flashlight back and forth looking at my surroundings. It was a complete circle cleared out in the thick of the woods and I could see what looked like what was left of a demolition of a building. Stone bricks and a mostly buried foundation with a trail heading deeper into the woods.  \\nWhat the hell is this? I wondered to myself. I could suddenly see needles of white piercing through the woods, luke had turned the car toward the woods and turned the lights back on they were calling my name. As I started walking back I kept the flashlight swinging toward the opposite side of the clearing. Was this the church Dylan read online about? I could suddenly feel my hair stand on end and could almost swear I saw something shining the light of my flashlight back I instantly took off back toward the road. The darkness will play tricks on your mind, you will make shapes in the black depths when there is nothing there. Regardless I was not going to find out there is coyotes out here and I was not about to be a mangy mutts night time snack. I raced back to the car, as I broke out of the brush onto the road I could see the car and Gary standing next to the driver door, with his hand resting on top of the open door, reassuring himself that Luke was not going to take off without him again.  \\n“What the hell man, where did you go?” Dylan yelled.  \\n“I just ran into the woods a little bit, I think I found the church!”  \\n“NO WAY? Its real?” Dylan exclaimed. “Well I mean its something, definitely a building but there isn’t much left of it, wanna see it?”  \\n“No way, I am not going in there” “What are you scared of some deer?” I sneered. I knew I was scared to go back too though. Even though I wasn’t sure, the thought of seeing something in the dark lingered in the back of my mind.  \\n“Wow look” Dylan said from still inside the car pointing down the road to the left.  \\nThe tree line seemed to break and there was an opening in thick trees, looking out over what seemed to be a large swamp. I later found out this is called Mud Lake, many people have drowned in this lake due to the mud being more then ten feet deep and it would swallow anyone who dared to venture out in it. Below is a picture of the spot I am talking about.\\n\\n[https://ibb.co/dQ9WbC9](https://ibb.co/dQ9WbC9)\\n\\n“This is where blood rock is. Supposedly there is a rock out there that bleeds. A long time ago some womens baby walked out there and drowned so she killed herself on the rock out there….” Dylan said grimly.\\n\\nSuddenly we heard a blood curdling scream of a woman crying out. We all jumped and immediately clamoured on the car. Luke Reved the car but it wasn’t in gear.  \\n“Chill out everyone!!!” Yelled Dylan…..  \\n“Oh my god…… it was the fucking radio…” Luke said turning the CD player off…. There was an avenged sevenfold CD in and it suddenly started playing and it was paused on the track Scream, which has a loud scream at the start.  \\n“Wow heh that was weird…..” said Gary  \\n“God damn it turn that off” I said laughing nervously as one does when they are still scared but cant control their reaction..  \\nGary was standing at the front of the car and I was standing on the driver side.  \\n“Don’t look guys I gotta take a leak” I said looking out over the clearing.\\n\\nI unzipped my pants and started relieving myself, “ FUCK YOU PRIM ROSE” I screamed out into the clearing “ FUCK YOU STUPID OLD LADY AND FUCK YOUR BABY, YALL PROBABLY DESERVED IT” I screamed wildly.\\n\\nI don’t know why I did that, something about the excitement maybe I was screaming into the dark to pointlessly make myself not so afraid but it was in vain. I Quickly regretted what I did.\\n\\nAs I zipped my pants up and turned back toward the car I saw it. In the darkness I heard the crack of branches and sticks and the stomping in the ground. I could see the bushes on the opposite side moving and parting in two as something raced toward us.  \\n“WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!!!!” Gary screamed.\\n\\n“GET IN GET IN” Luke frantically screamed. I jumped into the driver side window, hanging half out and Garry jumped on the hood gripping the top slit of the hood with all his might as Luke Threw the car into gear and took off. We were flying down the road. Luckly we were in a Camero and not much could catch it. Luke punched the car maybe about 40 yards and slowly stopped so Gary didn’t go flying off.  \\n“GET IN GET IN GET IN” Luke screamed. Gary ran around and jumped through the same window I had wriggled through and we all sat in grim silence as Luke raced us down the Gravel road. At the end of the road to our relief it suddenly opens up to reveal cornfields and the sky, the wonderful luminous moonlight filled sky, and a barn was off in the distance with a stale green bug light on the porch.  \\n“Did you see that” I panted looking from one friend to another.  \\n“I\\xa0 don’t know what it was I heard it and saw the bushes part open and jumped on the hood.” Garry said.\\n\\nAs we drove away I stared back at the cornfield that meets the woods and could see green eyes of what I hoped were deers reflecting in the moonlight.\\n\\nWe all told ourselves it was just a deer jumping through the bushes at us, but I knew better. I was facing toward it. It was much bigger then a deer and I saw the bushes literally part, as if someone was reaching through them. We never went back to Prim Rose and that day I learned to respect the dead, even if it was just stories because you never know.\\n\\n', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 5}\n",

I’m 90 years old, but it still haunts me to this day. After 30 or, I don’t know, 50 years, the cabin accident. The monster still haunts me, but I see him.\\n\\nI was exploring the mountains of Greece, lost in the snow. The storm came too fast, and I was freezing to death. Then I saw it—the cabin, barely visible through the blizzard. I stumbled inside, too exhausted to care about what might be lurking there.\\n\\nThe air was thick, heavy with something ancient. As I moved closer to the fire pit, I saw it. In the far corner of the room stood a creature—tall, skeletal, with eyes glowing like coals. Its skin was gray, stretched tight over its bones. It didn’t have a face, just a mass of shadows.\\n\\nI froze, my heart pounding. It began to move toward me, its limbs creaking like branches in the wind. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. It was pulling me in, as if it was meant to take me.\\n\\nThen the sunlight broke through the cabin’s window, and the creature recoiled. The light seemed to burn it, warping its form. It hissed and disappeared into the shadows, like smoke fading with the dawn.\\n\\nI ran. I don’t even remember how, but I ran—out of the cabin, through the snow, straight to a small convenience store in a nearby village. I slammed the door behind me, my chest heaving. I don’t know how I survived that night, but I’ll never forget what I saw.\\n\\nThe monster is still out there, waiting for the next person to wander into its trap.\\n\\nAfter I got in the convenience store, I slammed the door behind me, my breath coming in short gasps. The small shop smelled like old wood and stale coffee. The man behind the counter looked up from his magazine. He paused, his eyes scanning me, and then he asked, \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\nFor a second, I thought he might think I was a drug addict, the way I must’ve looked—wild-eyed, shaking, covered in snow. But I didn’t care. I was still shaking from what I had seen, the image of that monster burned into my mind.\\n\\n\"I... I just came from the cabin,\" I said, my voice hoarse. \"There’s something there, something terrible.\"\\n\\nThe man raised an eyebrow, as if he didn’t believe me, but I could see the hesitation in his eyes. So, I told him everything. The storm, the cold, the cabin in the distance. The shopkeeper’s warning. And then, when I finally stepped inside, how I saw it—the creature in the corner of the room, the way it moved toward me, its eyes glowing, its presence choking the air around me. I told him about the light breaking through the window and how the monster had disappeared. I left out nothing.\\n\\nBy the time I finished, the man was silent. He stood still, his face pale. His hands trembled slightly as he reached for the counter. For a moment, I thought he might dismiss me as insane. But then he spoke, his voice low, almost a whisper.\\n\\n\"You’re not the first to see it,\" he said, his gaze distant. \"People disappear around that cabin, year after year. They... they say it’s not just a monster. It’s something older, something that feeds off the darkness.\"\\n\\nHis words hit me like a wave, and I knew he wasn’t just humoring me. He was scared, like he’d seen it too—like he knew the truth.\\n\\nAnd in that moment, I realized something terrifying: the creature wasn’t just something that lived in the cabin. It was part of the mountain, part of the land. And no matter how many years passed, it would always be waiting, lurking in the shadows, ready to claim anyone foolish enough to wander too close.\\n\\nThe man stared at me, and for the first time since I stepped into the store, I felt like I wasn’t alone. But I also knew one thing: I had to leave the mountain. And I had to do it before it found me again.\\n\\nI don’t know what to do. The light doesn’t help anymore. The city’s noise doesn’t drown it out. It’s getting closer. And the worst part? I think it’s been following me all these years.\\n\\nI have done everything. I went to psychologists, hoping they could help me make sense of it, to help me forget. I take Xanax to relax, anything I can to calm the relentless fear. I’ve tried every treatment, every medication—P.O.S., whatever they told me would work. But it doesn’t work anymore.\\n\\nEven dementia, I thought, would erase this memory. I prayed for it, hoped for it. But no, dementia has erased everything. The faces, the names, the years, the moments. It’s taken so much. But it hasn’t taken that night. It hasn’t taken him.\\n\\nI remember the cabin. I remember the creature. I remember its eyes, its breath. I remember the cold, the dark, the silence. And I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve forgotten everything else—except that.\\n\\nI wake up in the middle of the night, gasping for air, and I know. I know he’s still out there, somewhere. I hear the scratching at the walls, the whispers in the corners of my mind. But most of all, I know—he knows where I am. And this time, there won’t be a light to save me.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 6}\n",

I stumbled across the house. It was old, windows boarded up, door creaked like it hadn’t opened in years. But it looked untouched, like it had just frozen in time. The kind of place that called to you, even though every instinct screamed not to go inside.\\n\\nI entered the living room. I noticed it: an old radio on a dusty table. I couldn’t resist. I plugged it in, static filled the room with a low hum.\\n\\nI was expecting a remnant from another era, nothing more. However, an odd thing happened as I turned the dial. The normal crackling was replaced with a clear but weak voice. A murmur.\\n\\n\"Leave.\"\\n\\nI went cold. My heart was racing. Though weak and nearly unidentifiable, the voice was distinct. My initial thought? An error. However, the voice returned when I increased the volume. This time, louder.\\n\\n“You shouldn’t be here. They’re coming.”\\n\\nI rushed to turn it off, but before I could, the radio crackled to life, filling the room with a distorted tone. The voice became clearer.\\n\\n\"A knock on your door will be heard at 11:47 PM tonight. Do not open it. They are not human.”\\n\\nI didn’t know what to think. Was it a joke? Maybe the house had prank equipment. But the voice was desperate. It felt real.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t get rid of the sense that I was being watched that night. My apartment, usually quiet, felt alive with an eerie presence. I tried to forget about the radio. But as the clock struck 11:47 PM, a knock came at the door. Three hard raps. My pulse spiked. I froze.\\n\\nI didn’t open it. I couldn’t. I thought back to the voice on the radio. “Do not open it. They are not human.”\\n\\nThe knock came again. And again.\\n\\nI waited. In silence.

The messages weren’t warnings anymore. They were prophecies. It knew things about me. Things I hadn’t told anyone. Things I didn’t understand. It began by listing events in my life that had not yet happened.\\n\\n“At 2:32 PM tomorrow, you’ll receive a call from a number you don’t recognize. Don’t answer it. It will be the last time you hear from anyone.”\\n\\nThe next day, the call came. I didn’t answer. The number was foreign. The voice on the other end? I’m sure it would have been nothing but a whisper. But the radio still crackled, growing louder, filling my ears with static.\\n\\nThe worst part? Every message, every warning, came true. They were more than predictions. They were instructions. If I followed them, I stayed safe. If I ignored them, something terrible happened.\\n\\n“There will be a fire. It will start on the second floor of your building. But if you leave now, you can stop it.”\\n\\nI ran out the door. The fire started that night, right where the radio had predicted. I couldn’t explain how it knew, but I began to trust it. I had to.\\n\\nBut some messages were too cryptic. The things it warned me about, I couldn’t control.\\n\\n“At midnight, they will come. They will be disguised as your family. Do not trust them. They are not who they appear to be.”\\n\\nThat’s when I made the mistake of going home. I thought I could outrun whatever was coming.

It was cheap, charming, and had a certain loneliness that matched the emptiness in her heart after her recent divorce. She didn’t mind the creaking floors or the drafts that whispered through the cracks in the windows. It was hers now. A fresh start.\\n\\nBut from the first night, something was wrong.\\n\\nAt first, it was subtle—just the occasional creak or groan of the old house settling. Then, around midnight, she started hearing whispers. Faint, unintelligible murmurs that seemed to come from deep within the walls. She chalked it up to her imagination—after all, old houses made strange noises, right?\\n\\nBut they didn’t stop.\\n\\nEvery night, the whispers grew louder. First, they sounded like distant voices, barely audible, as if they were speaking in a language she couldn’t understand. Then, they began to take on more shape, clearer words—words she knew.\\n\\n“Ella…”\\n\\nHer name echoed from the walls, soft but unmistakable.\\n\\n“Ella, come closer.”\\n\\nThe voice was calm, seductive, coaxing her to the hallway. At first, she resisted, locking herself in her bedroom, convinced she was just hearing things. But the whispers didn’t stop. They came at odd hours, and though they never seemed to belong to anyone, there was a sick familiarity to them—like someone was trying to draw her in.\\n\\nOne night, unable to sleep, she finally gathered the courage to investigate. With a flashlight in hand, she walked cautiously down the narrow hallway, the wooden floor creaking beneath her feet. The whispers grew louder as she neared the wall in the living room, the place where they always seemed to come from.\\n\\nShe pressed her ear against the cold, splintered wood, and the voices immediately grew frantic.\\n\\n“Come closer, Ella. Don’t be afraid. We’re waiting for you…”\\n\\nHer heart raced, but she couldn’t move. Something compelled her to press harder, to listen more intently. The walls felt alive, like they were breathing. Then, with a sudden, jarring crack, a voice—deep, guttural, like it was coming from the very bones of the house—spoke clearly.\\n\\n“We’ve been waiting for so long, Ella…”\\n\\nThe wall in front of her shuddered, a faint ripple running across the surface as if something inside was pressing against it. Her breath caught in her throat, and she staggered back, but the whispers didn’t stop.\\n\\nIn fact, they became louder, faster, more desperate. The floor beneath her feet seemed to vibrate with the energy of the voices—until the walls began to move.\\n\\nThe plaster split with a sharp crack, and from within the wall, something crawled out. Thin, pale arms, covered in deep scars, reached through the cracks in the plaster and gripped the edges, pulling something else through—something twisted, deformed. Its face was a blur of smeared flesh, its eyes wide and unblinking, as though it had been waiting for her, starving for her.\\n\\nShe screamed, stumbling back, but the thing was already halfway out, its grotesque fingers digging into the floor, dragging its body after it.\\n\\n“We’re here for you, Ella,” it rasped, its voice a sickening blend of dozens of others. “You’ve always known. We’ve always been waiting.”\\n\\nElla backed away, but the house seemed to close in around her, the walls contracting, the whispers now screaming her name.\\n\\n“Ella! Ella! ELLA!”\\n\\nWith a final, horrified scream, she turned and ran. But no matter how far she went, no matter how fast, the whispers followed. They were always there—in the walls, in the floor, in the air she breathed.\\n\\nAnd she knew, in that last terrible moment, as her legs gave out and the darkness took her, that the thing she had heard all along wasn’t trying to warn her.\\n\\nIt was waiting.\\n\\nAnd now it had her.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 4}\n",

The pay was good, and I thought it would be a fun, picturesque way to spend the winter, surrounded by snow-covered mountains and fresh air. The idea of being in a cozy lodge, watching the snow fall outside while the guests enjoyed their stay, seemed perfect. It was the kind of job you think about when you\\'re trying to escape the grind of city life, and everything about it felt like a dream. My first day was typical: I met the team, got my uniform, went through the usual onboarding stuff. The whole thing felt like a normal first day at a new job—nothing unusual, nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\nBut that all changed at the end of the day.\\n\\nPete, the manager, a wiry guy with a sharp, calculating gaze, called me into his office just before I was about to leave. He’s one of those people who gives off a strange vibe, the kind of person who makes you feel like you’re always being watched. He handed me a laminated sheet of paper without saying a word, his fingers stiff and cold as he passed it over. I noticed his eyes, dark and unreadable, never left mine.\\n\\n“These are the rules,” he said, his voice flat, almost too serious. “Follow them to the letter, or you won’t last here.”\\n\\nAt first, I thought it was some kind of weird hazing, a test to see if I was taking the job seriously. It’s not unusual for a new employee to be given a set of strange instructions or odd tasks. But something in Pete’s tone made me pause. He wasn’t joking. There was no warmth in his words, no sign of humor in his eyes. It felt... wrong, like he was telling me something I wasn’t supposed to hear.\\n\\nI took the paper from him, my fingers brushing against the cold laminate, trying to brush it off. “Rules are no problem,” I said, forcing a smile, hoping to lighten the mood. But Pete didn’t smile. His eyes remained cold, piercing, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was somehow being warned about something I had no understanding of yet.\\n\\nAs I walked away, holding that sheet of paper, I couldn’t help but glance at it. I didn’t know it at the time, but that was the moment everything started to change. Something told me that I should’ve paid more attention to those rules.\\n\\nThe list looked like this:\\n\\n1. Do not whistle while working, especially after sunset.\\n2. If you see a child alone on the slopes, do not approach them. Report it immediately and leave the area.\\n3. Never turn off the lights in the staff lodge, even if you’re the last one there.\\n4. If you hear music coming from an empty cabin, do not investigate. Notify Pete immediately.\\n5. Do not use the ski lift alone after 9:00 PM. If you find yourself on it, do not look down.\\n6. Avoid mirrors in the staff bathrooms after midnight.\\n7. If a guest asks you for directions to \"the old lodge,\" pretend you didn’t hear them and walk away.\\n8. Do not take photos of the forest or the mountain at dusk.\\n9. If you find a pair of skis standing upright in the snow with no one around, leave the area as quickly as possible.\\n10. Never, under any circumstances, speak about the “white shadow” to anyone.\\n\\nThe first few days were uneventful. I stayed inside after sunset, ignored any strange noises, and avoided the mirrors in the staff lodge after midnight. It was easy enough to follow the rules… until it wasn’t.\\n\\nThe first rule I broke was #1.\\n\\nIt was my third night, and I was clearing snow off the lodge steps while humming absentmindedly. The cold bit at my fingers, and my breath puffed in front of me in tiny clouds. Without realizing it, I started to whistle a tune—something cheerful to distract me from the freezing air. It wasn’t until the third or fourth note that I noticed the change.\\n\\nThe wind stopped.\\n\\nNot just slowed or died down, but\\xa0*stopped*. The air became unnaturally still, and it felt like the entire mountain was holding its breath. My own whistle cut off abruptly as I looked around, heart pounding. That’s when I heard it.\\n\\nA low, guttural whistle echoed back, coming from somewhere deep in the forest. It wasn’t a mimic of my tune; it was jagged and wrong, like the sound was being dragged out of something that wasn’t meant to whistle. I froze, my breath caught in my chest, as the sound grew louder, closer. The trees at the edge of the forest seemed darker now, their branches twisting unnaturally, reaching toward me.\\n\\nThen something moved. A shadow, tall and spindly, darting between the trunks too fast for me to make out. My legs felt like lead, but I forced myself to move, stumbling back up the steps and into the lodge. I slammed the door behind me and locked it, leaning against it as I tried to catch my breath.\\n\\nInside, the lodge was silent. Too silent. The usual creaks and groans of the old building were absent, and I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I peeked out the window, my breath fogging the glass. For a moment, I thought I saw a figure standing at the edge of the tree line, but when I blinked, it was gone.\\n\\nThe rest of the night, I stayed huddled by the fireplace, every light in the lodge turned on. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me, circling just out of sight. The windows… they felt like eyes, and every so often, I’d catch a flicker of movement in the corner of my vision. Too fast to be human. Too deliberate to be the wind.\\n\\nA few days later, I was working the western slopes when I spotted something unusual. It was one of those rare, eerily silent moments on the mountain. The wind had died down, and even the usual rustle of trees was absent, as if the whole area was holding its breath. That’s when I saw her: a small child sitting alone on the side of the slope, knees drawn up to her chest. Her old-fashioned ski outfit stood out immediately—it looked like something out of a vintage photograph, the kind you’d see in the lodge’s historical display cases. The colors were faded, the fabric oddly pristine, as though untouched by time or snow.\\n\\nShe didn’t seem cold, despite the chill in the air. Her pale face was tilted down, but her eyes… something about them was wrong. They weren’t crying or red from the cold. No, they seemed dull, almost lifeless, but at the same time… alert? Watching? It’s hard to explain, but they made my skin crawl. She wasn’t moving, just sitting there, perfectly still like she was waiting for something—or someone.\\n\\nInstinctively, I almost called out to her. My first thought was that she might be lost or hurt. But as I opened my mouth, a cold dread settled over me, freezing the words in my throat. My gut twisted as Rule #2 flashed in my mind:\\xa0*Don’t engage with anyone who shouldn’t be there.*\\n\\nI fumbled for my radio, my hands shaking slightly as I adjusted the dial. \"Pete?\" My voice came out quieter than I intended. \"There’s a kid on the western slope, sitting by herself. Looks… off. Old gear, pale face. What do I do?\"\\n\\nPete’s response was immediate and sharp. \"Leave. Right now. Don’t look at her. Don’t talk to her. Just go.\"\\n\\nThe urgency in his voice sent a shiver down my spine. Without another word, I turned my skis downhill and started gliding away as fast as I could without losing control. Every nerve in my body screamed to look back, to confirm she was still there… or gone. But I didn’t. I focused on the path ahead, each movement deliberate, keeping my breathing steady despite the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nAnd yet, I could\\xa0*feel*\\xa0her. That cold, intense gaze boring into my back like icy needles. It was as if her eyes were tethered to me, tracking my every move. My legs burned as I pushed myself harder, willing the slope to stretch further, faster, to get away from whatever I’d just seen.\\n\\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, I reached the base of the slope and dared to glance over my shoulder. The spot where she’d been was empty. No sign of the child, no disturbed snow, no tracks leading away. Just undisturbed white, pristine and eerily quiet.\\n\\nI stood there for a moment, catching my breath, the radio still clutched in my hand. \"Pete,\" I said, my voice trembling slightly. \"She’s gone.\"\\n\\nThere was a long pause before Pete responded. When he did, his voice was low and steady, but there was an edge to it. \"Good. Stick to the main trails for the rest of your shift. And remember the rules. Always.\"\\n\\nThe next one I broke was #3.\\n\\nIt was late, and I’d been the last one in the staff lodge again. Exhausted, I flipped off the lights as I left, forgetting the rule entirely. For a moment, the darkness was absolute, heavy like a physical presence pressing against me. Then, I felt it—a weight, like something was standing inches behind me. My breath hitched, and a chill crawled up my spine, so sharp and sudden it almost stole my balance.\\n\\nI froze, every instinct screaming at me to run, but my body wouldn’t move. My ears strained against the silence, desperate to catch a sound—any sound—but there was nothing. The stillness was deafening, amplifying the pounding of my heart. Slowly, I forced my legs to move, bolting for the exit as panic clawed at the edges of my mind. My fingers fumbled with the keys, slippery with sweat despite the cold. My hands were trembling so badly it took three tries to get the key into the lock.\\n\\nAs soon as I got outside, the lights inside flickered back on by themselves. The sudden brightness poured through the lodge’s windows, throwing everything inside into sharp relief. At first glance, it seemed normal—empty, still—but as my gaze lingered, I noticed something. A shadow, impossibly long and spindly, seemed to ripple against the far wall before it slipped out of sight into the deeper darkness.\\n\\nI staggered back, the door swinging shut behind me with a dull thud. My breath came in shallow gasps as I turned and walked quickly, almost stumbling, toward my car. I didn’t stop moving until I was halfway across the lot, where I finally dared to glance back.\\n\\nThe lodge stood there, silent and still, its lights steady as though nothing had happened. But I knew better now. I knew to never forget the rules again.  \\nThe worst was when I broke Rule #4.\\n\\nIt was late last night, and I was finishing up in the lounge after a long shift. The flickering of the fire and the hum of the lights were the only sounds in the otherwise quiet lodge. As I was gathering my things, I heard faint music drifting in from outside, a soft, eerie melody that seemed to float through the air. At first, I thought it was just the wind playing tricks on me, but the closer I listened, the clearer it became. The sound was coming from Cabin 3 — and I knew that cabin was unoccupied.\\n\\nCuriosity gnawed at me. I knew I should ignore it. After all, everyone who worked here knew Rule #4: Never enter an unoccupied cabin, no matter what. It was the most sacred of rules, one passed down from older co-workers, one that have been around for a while. There were stories, of course, rumors about strange happenings in the cabins that no one could explain. But they were just stories trying to scare the newbies, weren’t they?\\n\\nI tried to convince myself to let it go, to leave well enough alone. But the music…it pulled me in. I couldn\\'t resist. So, against my better judgment, I grabbed my jacket and headed outside, the cold night air nipping at my skin.\\n\\nAs I approached Cabin 3, the door was ajar, and the music grew louder, almost as if it were beckoning me. I hesitated for a moment, but my feet moved forward, drawn by some unseen force. The door creaked as I pushed it open further. Inside, the air was stale, but not as musty as I expected for a cabin that had been abandoned. The only light came from the dim glow of the moon filtering through the windows, casting long shadows across the wooden floor.\\n\\nAt first, I didn’t see anything unusual. The room was empty, the furniture covered in dust sheets, the fireplace cold and unused. But then I noticed the record player in the corner, a vintage model that looked out of place among the abandoned furniture. The needle was stuck on a warped vinyl, spinning in slow, uneven circles. The music it produced was haunting, beautiful, but utterly wrong. Each note felt dissonant, like it was trying to reach something but couldn’t.\\n\\nI stood there, rooted to the spot, the melody filling the space around me, twisting the air. It was a sound that seeped into your bones, making your skin crawl, but also pulling you deeper. I didn’t know why I was still standing there, but I couldn’t tear myself away. Something about the music felt familiar, like I’d heard it before, but from a lifetime ago.\\n\\nThen, as I turned to leave, the door slammed shut behind me with a violent thud, startling me so much I almost jumped out of my skin. My heart began to race, my breath quickening as I fumbled with the handle. The door wouldn’t budge. Panic surged through me, and I yanked harder, but the door remained closed, as though something — or someone — was holding it shut from the other side. The music hadn’t stopped. If anything, it had grown louder, more insistent, almost mocking.\\n\\nI don’t remember exactly how I got out. One moment, I was frantically pulling at the door, and the next, I was standing in the dark, cold night again, gasping for breath. My mind was a blur. I didn’t even remember the walk back to the lodge, but somehow, I found myself at the front door, my hand still trembling as I knocked.\\n\\nPete was waiting for me when I stepped inside. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. His gaze was enough — that look of disappointment, like he already knew what I’d done. Like he could see the mistake I’d made before I even had the chance to say anything. His eyes didn’t hold anger, only this deep, quiet understanding of how foolish I’d been. And then, just like that, he turned and walked away without a word.\\n\\nThe air in the lodge felt heavy, thicker than it had before. As I stood there, the music from Cabin 3 still echoing in my mind, I realized just how badly I’d broken Rule #4. And how, in doing so, I might have just sealed my fate.\\n\\nThat night I almost broke Rule #5, too.\\n\\nThe ski lift is the fastest way to get back to the cabins after a late shift, especially when the snow is thick and the air is biting cold. I’d been considering it all evening as I glanced at the clock on the wall: 9:12 PM. I was tired, and the idea of a quick ride up seemed almost too tempting to pass up. But then I hesitated. It wasn’t the safest option. I knew I should hike instead. So, with a sigh, I pulled on my gloves and grabbed my bag, setting out on the trail.\\n\\nThe path was quieter than usual, the snow crunching softly beneath my boots. Halfway up, though, something made me stop. I looked up, and that\\'s when I saw it: the ski lift moving, its creaky sound breaking the stillness of the night. No one was supposed to be on it that late. It was far too late for anyone to be up there, especially alone.\\n\\nYet, there was a figure—a pale blur—sitting in one of the chairs. It didn’t move like a person. It was unnaturally still, almost as if the figure were searching for something. Or someone. The way it shifted and swayed in the chair, its head turning slowly as though scanning the dark, made my heart race. It didn’t look human, not fully. There was something off about it, like a shadow more than a person, a distortion in the night.\\n\\nMy breath caught in my throat as I stared at it, frozen in place. It was moving slowly but deliberately, as if it knew exactly what it was doing. I could feel my pulse quicken. I’m sure it would have seen me if I’d taken the lift. It would’ve been impossible to miss me, and I wasn’t sure what would’ve happened if it had.\\n\\nInstead, I kept my eyes on it for as long as I dared, then turned away, my legs trembling as I continued up the trail. The lift kept moving in the corner of my vision, but I didn’t look back again. Something told me that if I did, it would be the last time I’d feel safe in that place.\\n\\nThen came Rule #6.\\n\\nIt was just past midnight, and I’d just finished a long shift. My body ached, my mind was numb, and all I wanted was to wash up and unwind. The staff bathroom was the only place open at that hour, so I made my way down the dimly lit hallway, the fluorescent lights buzzing faintly overhead. It was eerily quiet, too quiet for that time of night, and the familiar creaks and groans of the old lodge felt unsettling as I entered the bathroom.\\n\\nI knew better than to look directly into the mirrors, though. Rule #6 was clear about that. It was one of those things that everyone learned quickly when they started working here. There were whispers, of course—stories about what happened to those who stared too long at their own reflection, about the things that didn’t reflect back. But I’d always assumed they were just old superstitions. After all, mirrors are just mirrors, right?\\n\\nI kept my head down, focused on the sink as I turned on the faucet, the cold water splashing over my hands and face. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the chill of the water soothe my flushed skin, and then I caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye.\\n\\nAt first, I thought it was just my own reflection, moving with me as I adjusted my posture. But then I noticed something was wrong. My reflection wasn’t following me. It stayed there, frozen, unnaturally still, while I continued to move around the sink, my hands trembling as I wiped my face.\\n\\nI froze. The reflection didn’t blink, didn’t shift. It just stood there, staring back at me. But it wasn’t\\xa0*me*. I could tell right away that something was off. Its eyes weren’t the same—too wide, too empty. And then, the corners of its mouth twitched, slowly curling into a grin that was far too wide to be natural. It spread like it was stretching something that wasn’t meant to be stretched, a grotesque smile that seemed to pull at its face, distorting the skin. The teeth—there were too many of them, jagged and sharp, too sharp for a human mouth. I felt a wave of nausea rise in my stomach.\\n\\nMy heart skipped a beat as I realized something else. The reflection wasn’t just smiling; it was mocking me. It wasn’t moving with me anymore. It was\\xa0*watching*\\xa0me. The grin stretched wider still, impossibly wide, as if it were about to split the reflection’s face in half. I could feel my own smile beginning to falter, but I couldn’t stop it. The more I tried to force my expression back to normal, the wider its smile grew.\\n\\nPanic surged through me. I stumbled backward, the sound of my boots scraping against the floor far too loud in the silence of the bathroom. I wanted to scream, but my throat was dry, and all I could manage was a strangled gasp. My eyes flicked frantically to the door, and in that moment, I realized I was no longer alone in that room. The reflection in the mirror was watching me, its head tilted to one side, as though considering its next move.\\n\\nIt didn’t just smile now. It\\xa0*grinned*—like it had all the time in the world. The grin deepened, the teeth seeming to elongate into something monstrous. I could feel my own jaw aching, my face tightening in a futile attempt to resist. But I couldn\\'t stop it. I couldn\\'t look away. And for a moment, it felt like I wasn’t\\xa0*me*\\xa0anymore—like the reflection had taken me over completely.\\n\\nThe laughter came next.\\n\\nIt started as a low chuckle, soft and sinister, and then it grew louder. It was my voice, or at least, it\\xa0*sounded*\\xa0like it was my voice, but it was warped, twisted into something wrong. The laughter echoed in the small room, reverberating off the cold tiles, and the reflection’s eyes gleamed with something hungry, something far darker than any human could hold.\\n\\nI couldn’t breathe. My hands were shaking so violently now that the water splashed across the counter, droplets catching the dim light. The reflection’s laughter morphed into something far worse—a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl, a laugh that didn’t belong in a human throat.\\n\\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had all begun, everything stopped. The laughter died. The grin remained. But it wasn’t moving anymore. My reflection was still, as though it was waiting, watching.\\n\\nI could barely think. I just knew I needed to get out of there. I didn’t dare look back as I stumbled toward the door, the air thick and oppressive in my lungs. I pulled it open and nearly fell out into the hallway, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum.\\n\\nI don’t know how long I stood there, gasping for breath, trying to shake the image from my mind. But when I finally forced myself to look back, I could still see the bathroom door slightly ajar, the mirror just beyond it, waiting.\\n\\nI never went back in. Not once. And from that night on, I made sure to never break Rule #6 again. Not even for a second.\\n\\nThat brings me to now. It’s 3:22 AM, and I’m hiding in the basement supply closet because I couldn’t make it anywhere else. Something began following me after I didn\\'t seem to notice the skis standing upright quickly enough. Something is outside the door. I can hear it breathing, a wet, rattling sound that makes my stomach churn. It’s been scratching at the door for the past ten minutes, long, desperate clawing like something is trying to rip its way in. It sounds like it’s getting closer, the scraping growing louder with each pass. My pulse is racing, and my skin feels like it\\'s crawling. I can barely breathe, trying to stay as silent as possible, but my heart is thumping so loudly that I’m terrified it’ll hear it too.\\n\\nI don’t know what to do. I can’t stay in here forever. But I can’t leave either. The door’s not strong enough to hold whatever that thing is for long, and I don’t know what’ll happen if it gets in. I don’t know if I can survive whatever\\'s out there. My phone battery is at 12%, and I’m too afraid to move too much, even to plug it in. My hands are shaking so badly that I can barely hold it steady enough to type.\\n\\nI’m posting this here, on Reddit, because I don’t know where else to turn. I’ve seen strange things before, but nothing like this. I can’t tell anyone here what’s going on. No one would believe me. But maybe, just maybe, someone on here knows what’s happening or can help me figure out what to do. Please, if you’ve heard of anything like this, if you know what this thing is, please let me know. Anything. I need help.\\n\\nI’ll keep posting as long as I can, but my battery is draining fast, and I’m afraid that when it’s gone, so will be my chance to get this message out. I just hope someone reads this before it’s too late.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 52}\n",

Sometimes I wake up after experiencing someone's death. This one was unique. Maybe I will continue sharing my experiences, but this one is just for Donny. There are things he needs to know; however he might view it. It’s not directly from me, but there's darkness around him.\\n\\n***\\n\\nWe know the city doesn’t sleep, not in the early morning for a quiet hour. Not when the student sets his laptop down to rest. The city doesn’t sleep when the sun rises, nor when the ill catch the busses on quiet streets. When the sun rises and shines on the seats, it falls into the hair of slickened scalps and tight ponytails. The faces of the people who come in different phases. A drunk, on their way home from a long night. The middle-aged woman is on a brisk walk, jaywalking the road. Sometimes it shines on the homeless man, turning and pulling the blanket over his head. The light shines from the tall buildings and reflects on everyone. The concrete blocks identify themselves as a person does at their first meeting. Everyone knows what the blocks mean when they say to them, *“Hello this is what I am”.* Then the people spend their day keeping up with the world, waiting for the sun to go back down.\\n\\nHe stands from the seat and I watch, waiting for him to see his shoes. The bus waits for people to get off, its doors open, and Donny is tying his shoes. Tired and late for a meeting a woman behind him taps her fingers on the back of a chair. The voices and chattering of those behind dull into a blur. Everyone tumbles onto the pavement together, seemingly in rows, and he jerks aside.\\n\\nWe walk together down the street, and a slew of heavy-headed pedestrians exit a building spreading apart. Maybe for a moment, he feels like a piece of straw or grass, collected in a field and shapeless; but I see his eyes and how he tips his head up at the sky, gazing at the tall buildings. The buildings above him reflect, and the heat of the sun touches his cheeks. He breathes in until his entire chest is filled.\\xa0\\n\\n*‘Like a clean avalanche,’* I say.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n*‘Here we are.’*\\n\\nHe's sitting\\xa0down pulling his bag off, just as\\xa0Anne comes to sit in her chair. I know what he's thinking\\xa0sometimes. In\\xa0silence, he feels the bumps from under his skin as if paper were over his bones, or as if some elastic material was stretched over him. I watch his hands clutch the elbows tightly. Underneath the fingers are white, like the flesh is holding on to a mark.\\n\\n*“Stop that.”* I wait for him to stop, and he puts his hands in his lap.\\n\\n'Donny, where are you?' A\\xa0calm female’s voice protrudes into the thick room.\\n\\nA breath escapes, hazardous from throat congestion. His eyes dart and glaze over the office, they fall on me. I look back, studying him.\\n\\n'Sorry, what did you say?’ he stops and sighs. He puts his face in his hands as if trying to wipe away dirt, or the hair in his eyes. He says, ‘I'm sorry I don't feel well lately.’\\n\\n'Donny?’ Her eyes probe. ‘How has your medication been?' She checks the clipboard in her hands.\\n\\n'I came off them since two weeks ago,’ he says.\\n\\nI scoff. ‘*Two weeks ago.’* He looks at me wide-eyed and I stop speaking.\\n\\n'You didn't consult me before you did this? I wonder why you stopped taking them when you seemed to be so doing well on them,' she says.\\n\\n'I’m not sure why I stopped, I was feeling- I didn't need them anymore,' he says bluntly. 'I came off them quickly. I thought it would be easy, but I felt like I was losing something.'\\n\\nHis fingers are shaking at the memory of our weekend together, after that first night when I waited for him to flush his pills from the toilet bowl.\\n\\n‘*Do you miss being alone with me now?’*\\n\\n'Well, I would imagine so, that is not nearly enough time. You may still feel the effects now.' She says it disapprovingly, crossing one leg over the other in some frustration maybe.\\n\\n'I felt better after a time, this is new.'\\n\\n'You’re feeling anxious,' she states.\\n\\n'It's worse than anxious, I feel…' he trails off. 'Someone is always in the room, but now more than ever I fear myself.'\\n\\n'Why are you afraid of yourself?'\\n\\n*‘You must be crazy; you think she knows you’re crazy?’*\\n\\n\\xa0His chest rises and falls, eyes twitching towards me.\\n\\n'Because I'm losing myself again, and this time it isn't a problem with medication- I feel crazy, but that isn't who I am is it? Are you afraid of what your mind does?'\\n\\n'I have known what crazy is, Donny, you are not crazy.' She pauses. 'Sometimes we’re triggered by something that’s happened, has anything happened to you recently?'\\n\\n'It doesn't have to be much.' He sits back and sighs. 'A cold stare, or a confused look,\\xa0reminds me I'm different. But I’m not that different, am I?’\\n\\n'Sometimes people can detect fear, just like an animal. What are you afraid of?' She asks.\\n\\n'Making a mistake,' he says thinking. 'I’m afraid of... Maybe something more, something with me. I haven’t made up my mind yet.’\\n\\n'Perhaps you don't want to disappoint people, that is common for people suffering from your illness,’ she points out.\\n\\n‘*It’s common for you, to disappoint.’*\\n\\nHe ignores me. 'Yes, that too... I'm afraid of being alive and I avoid it, I avoid living. I haven't gotten my license yet; I took a bus here. Aren’t you afraid of being alive?'\\n\\n'Most people are afraid of death. You have many years left to live Donny, for now, it is okay to spend time working on yourself,' she says simply.\\n\\nHe looks at the wall, the frustration on his face. 'I don't think I’ll live a very long life.'\\n\\n'Why do you believe that?'\\n\\nHe looks at his feet, at the loose laces on his sneakers. 'I have this feeling like someone is waiting for me.'\\n\\nShe shifts forward listening.\\n\\nHe shakes his head steadily. 'I feel it, something out there. There’s something they can’t see, pulling me in. I know things, I see things.’\\n\\nSitting back again, she says, 'Why do you think you’re afraid? Last week you mentioned your mother was disapproving of you as a child.’\\n\\n'Yes, I might find some answers from the past, but I still don't understand why I am this way.'\\n\\n*‘You don’t even remember your past do you,\\xa0your life.’*\\n\\n'Does the fear have a face?'\\n\\n'This fear is unknowable to me.\\xa0It shifts and morphs. Fear must be buried deep inside of me somewhere. I think maybe it's stored in my bones, unreachable.’ He pauses.

First what flashes in your mind is Jesus, bleeding at the cross, eyes wide, looking down at you in disbelief. He reaches out like a bloody handshake, his eyes peering through a glowing crown of thorns. But you whip us away, through a vortex of colours and light. Like when you closed your eyes at night and opened them in the morning to somewhere new. Soon suburbia sits, a little yellow house you grew up in. The smell of soap and candle wax in the air. Together we walk into the empty place, sandwiches are set on the table with the succulents. It looks like they are made of wax. We enter a blue room and see a little boy, turning a plane in his hand through the air. I watch him stop. He twists around to look up at you and fear brims his eyes. I crouch down, resting my hand on his shoulder, and his eyes dancing with a million stars winding through the abyss. Constellations build themselves and stars die. Worlds implode and a million drops of rain fall, all in the form of tears.\\n\\nHere the streets of suburbia reflect the lines of your face. And you know everything here, the houses, the sun, the moon, are the creations of a god. The place they go sometimes; to the empty buildings, or the cakes left on the stands. The empty computer rooms, the uncapped bottles, rows, and rows of books stopped half off the shelf. Some find the pearly gates of an empire, and some find hell. The decidedly eternal punishment, the dark pits that dwell in the back of every human experience.\\n\\nThe empty expanses are a weight you feel you wore on your shoulders heavily, a hard weight. The weight, though choosing, a life in humanity. They, writhing in the dark cloak, in the fear of the chaos they are bound by. Seeking comfort and clarity. Subverting at every turn, through a fumbling mass of children who swear to have answers. Humanity: the collection of experiences through uncertainty. An experience that forces us to collect stones and build walls around ourselves for safety.\\n\\n\\xa0So Donny, please… let me beg and ask…what if we live, and what if we die?\\n\\nAfter all, we’re all stardust baby.\\n\\n\\xa0\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 5}\n",

With the Meta Quest 3 and the Apple Vision Pro on the market, it's time to start developing some real applications that will have a positive impact in the world. My company has been working hand-in-hand with private prison companies to do just that. Here are some of our latest innovations.\\n\\nPrivate prisons have been a hotbed for unethical behavior for decades, creating terrible conditions for inmates. But we don't want that to remain. Despite the allegations, the private prisons are hard at work to improve conditions and make prison more like a rehab than a dungeon. Fixing this is hard - so to get it right we should focus on providing better experiences for the inmates. This is where VR comes in! Imagine - we could design specific scenarios and lives for inmates to live through. Whatever lessons they need to be taught could easily be transferred to them as direct experiences. But don't take my word for it, here are a few great examples:\\n\\nInmate A is in prison for domestic violence. He beat his wife, then he beat his children. Uh oh, sounds like solitary confinement is needed! Thing is, nobody learns anything from solitary confinement. It's just a padded room, where you sit for a while until you get released and you go and repeat whatever heinous thing you did before. But what if instead of a padded room, it was a curated VR experience? Now inmate A is no longer just biding his time. He's reliving the pain and horror of what he did over and over. He's forced to rewatch his wife and children sobbing, begging for a way out, watching his own hands deny them of that. And this can just replay for weeks, months, years. Lesson learned, criminal! The whole world is about to learn a lot of empathy. If only we had this sooner.\\n\\nNow take for example inmate B. B is a serial killer. A real psychopath with no feelings for others. We're not going to get through to inmate B with any emotional experiences. But not to worry! We've got something perfect for inmate B. A simulator where the inmate has full roam of a house, but someone in the house is trying to kill him. He can try to escape for as long as he wants... but don't worry, we've programmed it so that eventually, he will be caught. And we don't want the VR killer to be limited to VR tools - we've implemented all sorts of real-world consequences that the VR killer can activate - pepper spray, loud noises, tazers, needles - all things to make the killer really afraid of their VR death; without actually puting them at risk!  Using these tools, we can rehabilitate killers in ways that we never thought possible before. \\n\\nNow to inmate C. C is a white-collar criminal - in the past just inelligible for solitary confinement. But with our new system, VR confinement is appropriate for everyone! We can put them in a small room, but give them a luxurious prison loft that every white-collar criminal deserves. And don't worry - we'll still be focused on teaching them a lesson. In this simulated environment, they can make investments but they'll always tank. They can hire help, but the help will never clean their room enough, will rearrange their stuff, and will often steal small items they grew attached to. Take that rich criminals! And the best part is - we don't have to keep it comfortable. If they're not learning their lesson - we can switch to zaps, blunt force, drugs, and more to keep them in line. There really are no creative limits, and we're open-sourcing some of our torture algorithms to make sure they're always effective and appropriate!\\n\\nSo how do we do it? With our patented AI, we just decribe the crime, and the appropriate punishment that will prevent that person from ever committing that crime again comes out! The prison system has never been so efficient - graduate from your bespoke course and we guarantee you will never be willing to commit your crime again. No one who comes through it will be capable of being a repeat offender. And if they are incapable of graduating - they just won't be able to come through it! If you can't learn, it will kill you. No longer does the death penalty have to be a controversial topic! We've solved it down to a science.\\n\\nSo far, all of this has been about criminals. But it would be criminal to prevent society from taking advantage of this technology. So we invite you - send your troubled teens to us! Just describe what bad behaviors they're exhibiting, and we'll have a course ready to prevent that from ever happening again. We ask that you send them to us and refrain from checking in for 3 weeks. At that point, we guarantee the changes will be mind-blowing! And if you're not completely satisfied, we offer a full refund. There is literally no reason NOT to take advantage of this as soon as possible!\\n\\nI hope, by now, you fully appreciate the value of everything being offered here. In the age of VR and AI, it would be foolish to continue trying to manually solve problems. What I've given here are just a few examples of what we can do - but in reality we're ready to take on ANY and ALL problems you might think you have. The solutions are all here - call today!\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 13}\n",

I know I’m not the best writer compared to her, but Billie asked me to come on here this time, she told me this story was “best told first person”, so you're stuck with me for now. Sorry, not sorry. ;)\\n\\nThe next day I woke up later in the afternoon, I was exhausted from packing with Billie’s family and really needed those extra hours of sleep. I texted Billie, replying to her 8 million worried messages before walking downstairs. My mom and I were sitting on the couch, she was reading and I was looking out the window watching my neighbors walk by, walking their dogs, drinking coffee on their porch, all that stuff. My mom sighed and put her book down, reading something on her phone. I asked her what was wrong to which she replied she forgot to text Billie's mom back. I assured her it was fine, and so she sent a quick text before running upstairs to change or something.\\xa0\\n\\nI laid back on the couch looking at the ceiling, there was a small mark right above me. I couldn't tell if it was a scratch or a bug, either way, I didn’t want to find out and moved to the kitchen for a cup of water. My mom walked downstairs and told me she was going to clean out the shed before it rained again. I wished her luck and reminded her that I would be in the garage working on the car. She smiled at me warmly and went outside. I sat in the quiet for a little before I changed my clothes to work.\\n\\nI walked into the garage, it was dark and dusty. Every time I walked into the garage I always felt this knot in my stomach. I wasn't the biggest car guy,\\xa0 I mean hell if you were to ask me a question about cars when I was younger I would tell you to get a life and tell you five million monster facts or something. I just never was into cars, but my dad, he loved ‘em, older cars a least. He would take me to the garage to work on this damn car almost every other day, all he wanted was to get this thing running, but it never was ready, always a new problem to fix.\\xa0\\n\\nI flipped on the lights and closed the door behind me. An old 1956 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, originally a bright orange, but now the paints just faded to a gross yellow. I tried my best for the better half of 8 years to get this thing going, and I felt I was nearly there. Every time I look at it all I see is my dad staring back at me. I wish I tried harder when I was younger. I wish I could've had the reality of us driving together in it, but I didn’t.\\n\\nI walked over to the small shelf with all my stuff and grabbed the shit I needed. I worked on it for a few hours before I came out and made myself a sandwich. I was sitting at the table when my mom came downstairs. She looked at me, before asking me why I didn’t make her one as well, I looked at her with a smug smile before pointing at her plate that was sitting on the counter. She laughed and walked into the kitchen, grabbing her sandwich, and sitting next to me. We talked for a little while longer before I went back to work. I was trying to find my safety glasses when I saw Billie's mom walk past the garage. I was going to say hi, but I figured they were just going to leave, so I just let her be.\\n\\nI heard the door open and shut before I threw my headphones on. I sat for a while, looking for another thing to fix when I thought I heard something outside the garage. I took my headphones off and I heard something break. I stood up and ran to the door, I grabbed at the knob, but it wouldn’t open. I threw myself against it but It wouldn’t move. I could hear my mom yelling, I yelled trying to get through, begging my mom to open the door, begging to know what was wrong,\\xa0 but I just couldn’t get to her. I pulled the garage door open and ran to the front, it was locked. I turned to my neighbors all around me and yelled for help, but they just looked like I was crazy. I clenched my fist in frustration and shoved my elbow through the door's window, cutting my arm against the broken glass as I reached for the knob. I swung the door open and expected to see the worst to hear the worst, but there was absolute silence.\\n\\nI got into the house and looked around, it looked untouched. I grabbed a kitchen knife and walked in further. My mom was nowhere in sight. I stood there, my hands shaking. I didn't know what to do. I just looked around, until I heard slamming from upstairs, and I yelled for whoever was there to get out of my house, then it was quiet again. I heard my bedroom door open slowly.\\xa0 I could hear its voice. It growled.\\n\\n\\xa0Like a fucking animal.\\n\\nThough it didn’t sound right, it sounded like somebody screamed all day and then tried to imitate an animal. I couldn't see anything, the top of the stairs was shrouded in darkness. I screamed at it again then I heard it cough, a painful dry cough. It was quiet for a while before it called my name. It was my mom, at least, my brain wanted to believe it was her. My whole body screamed at me to believe it was her, but I knew better than to believe this thing. I clenched my jaw, waiting for it to move but it just stood there.\\xa0\\n\\nI could hear it breathing, its voice may have sounded like hers, but Its breath showed the truth, it was heavy and low like a man’s. Then I heard the sirens, and so did it. I waited there staring up the stairs, I can only imagine it was staring right back at me. I slowly backed up, walking to the light switch behind me. I put my hand against the wall and slowly reached for it. I flipped on the light, but I could only see its eyes peeking from my door in the hallway.\\n\\nIt was my mother's eyes.\\xa0\\n\\n“What do you do, where is my mom?!” I screamed.\\n\\n“Her” eyes widened and said, “Markus, don’t be silly, why don’t you come up here and help me?”\\n\\nI just looked at it and told it to come out. It started to open the door. I expected to see its long discolored fingers wrap around the door, to see it begin to stand up, rising to the top of the door, but that wasn't what I saw.\\n\\nWhat I saw was my mother.\\n\\nIts eyes, warm. Its smile, comforting. Half its body showing in the light.\\n\\n“Markus, why don’t you come up here.” It said, much lower than before.\\n\\nI looked at it, really looked at it. It looked like her yet so different, the skin, the mouth, the hands, the eyes. It was as if my mother had a twin, its complexion looked softer than my mother's, and it had a wider face and a comforting expression. I felt as if my brain was tricking my body, my shoulders relaxed and I lowered the kitchen knife slowly. I knew this wasn’t my mom yet I felt comfort in this thing's presence, I closed my eyes before looking back up at it.\\n\\nThis fucking thing, it ruined my life, I have spent so many years of my life trying to pretend this thing never existed, but it’s impossible to deny now. It opened the door wide, exposing its entire body, looking at me with a twisted smile. Its eyes widened with each second. It looked down at me with a twisted expression of pure happiness. I could see its jaw was hanging wide open. It took a step forward. I heard cars pull up infront of my house and I quickly glanced behind me.\\n\\nI looked up the stairs, its face was filled with anger and frustration, but it just shut the door violently, sending a strong vibration through my body. I ran upstairs to search for my mom, she was lying upstairs in her room. She had glass sticking from her side, I hovered my hands over her not knowing what to do. I heard the door open and I begged for help. When police searched the house, it was gone.\\xa0\\n\\nThat thing nearly killed her and It would have killed me if I had been inside. When we made it to the hospital they rushed her away from me and I was left alone waiting in that cold hallway not knowing what would happen next. I sat in silence waiting for hours until they got her to a room. I walked in slowly and sat myself next to her. I tried to talk with her but she was coming in and out of consciousness. She was just in so much pain, all because of me, because I wanted to live my life like a normal person.\\xa0\\n\\nI felt like a failure, I couldn’t protect her. I failed her, my dad, Billie, all because I wanted to play pretend. I felt so ashamed. My hands were shaking so badly, I couldn’t tell if it was from fear or hatred. I looked down at my hands.\\n\\n\\xa0I couldn’t pretend anymore.\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 6}\n",

JJ\\n\\nPart (1)\\n\\nMy name is Talib, and I have been admitted to a psychiatric ward here in Winter Haven, FL. It has been 3 years since I’ve been admitted by the state here as a permanent resident and I think now is a perfect time to tell everyone why.\\n\\n\\xa0I first started working at South Florida Baptist Hospital when I was 23 years old, I lost my grandma at 18, She was the last bit of family that I had left after my parents died in a car accident and when she passed, I was truly alone. I had to support myself and ended up ditching school and hopped around from Job to Job, after a few years I landed an interview at the South Baptist Hospital that my parents were treated at. I told myself I would never set foot in that hospital again, but with no one to fall on I was left with no other choice. The job was simple. I was a Support Technician; I was tasked with cleaning the hospitals six-floors and maintaining a professional attitude with Patients and Other staff members. But 5 months into the job I really started to hate it, cleaning after Doctors and Nurses who act like you don’t exist and even the thought of your parents passing away in the same hospital didn’t help with what I was going through. I never really recovered after their accident, even having my grandma support me I still felt alone, scared of what would become of me, when she passed away. My fears were reality.\\n\\nThe days were long and with the responsibility of cleaning the hospital by yourself can be boring but when done right the day can easily fly. I was about to leave when I got a call from my boss saying that a few rooms needed some clean sheets on the sixth floor. Our Linen guy had to leave early so I was stuck finishing his job with the promise of an hour of comp time. I grabbed a cart and headed to the elevator. Crammed like a pencil in a new pack, I was finally free at my stop. After traversing through what seemed like a traffic jam on I-4. I Finally placed the linen cart in a corner adjacent of the hallway. Turning back around an older lady was waving her hand and calling me over from one of the rooms. Usually, our job prohibits us from talking to patients ensuring that we are not liable for upsetting them or when they hurt themselves, but nobody was helping her so why not? I walked to the room. “Yes ma’am?” “Hey honey do you mind if I can get an extra blanket, please?” she asked. I smiled and turned to the cart grabbing a blanket out the cart and making my way back placing it gently at her feet. “Would you like me to cover you?\\' I asked “Ahh yes Dear”.\\n\\nWhile unfolding the blanket I caught a glimpse of my hands, covered in blood shocked I looked up and was looking at my deceased grandmother as blood streamed from her mouth and onto the floor in the living room holding her in my arms, Feeling her fleeting presence wandering away. I placed my head on to her chest crying and mumbling to myself “I’m sorry… I’m sorry”, “sorry for what dear?” I was back in the room still holding onto the blanket preparing to place it over her legs, I hurried and covered her apologizing “I’m sorry miss...” \\xa0Seeing her has been a new normal occasion for me and I can never understand why I was plagued with seeing my grandmother in such a horrible state. Embarrassed by looking like a creep I was hoping she would just thank me and let me go but I was wrong.\" My name is Clara I hope I’m not keeping you dear, but you seemed troubled do you want to talk for a while?” I couldn’t say no and by the looks of it she didn’t have many visitors, this usually happens to a lot of our patients, and I felt sorry for her, So I stayed, and I tried to keep to myself the best I could.\\n\\nFor the next hour I got to know Clara. She was 46 years old and had a Total Knee Replacement and was stuck here for the next 6 weeks for recovery, we talked about everything, and I was in complete shock when finding out that she had just lost her son in a car accident a year ago. We couldn’t help but relate losing the people that we loved. She was incredibly wise and gave me advice on some of the stuff I was struggling with. She honestly made me happy and felt seen, So every day after my shift I would pay her a visit and talk with her for hours. Weeks went by, and she was moving through her recovery in high spirits and before we even knew it. It was her last day as a patient.\\n\\n\\xa0I promised her that I would see her off at four thirty. She was being transferred out at five o’clock, so I had a thirty-minute gap to go to the gift shop. I started heading to her room patiently waiting for the elevator doors to open I stepped off and started to walk to her room, going around concerned parents and nurses. I stopped feeling the hairs on my neck stand. The air was thin feeling my body shake with fear as this lanky man walked past me towering over the heedless groups of people. It walked with no urgency, taking his hands out of his pockets revealing stained hands rubbing them together as red flakes fell to the daisy-colored floor. I started to follow not only was this guy creepy, but he was heading towards Claras’ room. I Picked up the pace trying to go around the figure, but a nurse bumped right into me spilling a tray of food all over me and her. I tried to apologize but looking ahead I noticed a shadow going into Claras’ room I ran squeezing through families and dodging wet hazardous signs placing my hand on the frame of the door I froze.\\n\\nThe figure was injecting an EpiPen into her leg. Hearing Clara cry out for help, but with no remorse the creature kept stabbing. I didn’t know what to do, but it wasn’t stopping, stabbing two more EpiPens in the same leg. “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HER!” I yelled, it turned to me looking dead in my eyes and smiled.\\xa0 I couldn’t move, in a desperate act to save her I summoned every ounce of courage I had and rushed the tall fucker screaming for it to stop. I woke up, my head pounding, feeling the side of my head pressed against the floor by the security guardsI tried to move my hands but they were bound. Pleading to let me go, I cried out “IT WASN’T ME!” “HE DID THIS, YOUR LETTING HIM GET AWAY!” I tried to look up seeing four nurses attempting to resuscitate Clara as she shook violently on the bed, I was forced to stand up and was dragged from the room I couldn’t look away. I saw my friend slowly die in front of me hearing the sound of her heart Vach machine ring down the hallway. she was dead, and I was blamed.\\n\\nDue to being in the room alone with the Clara I was taken into custody and questioned by the police on the events of her death and an investigation began I tried to tell them that there was someone else in the room. I swore up and down but couldn’t give a full description. No one remembered seeing a lanky guy with red-stained hands walking around the hospital. They thought I was insane., The story started hitting headlines, The top story? \\xa0\\xa0“A Support Technician Murders Patient!”. Although with the lack of physical evidence Tieng me to injecting Clara with a deadly amount of Epinephrine. The case went cold. Two days later I was let go of my job.\\n\\nAfter everything I had worked for washed away by the media and accusations of me murdering my friend, I struggled to find work and fell behind on my rent. I was soon back to square one. Unable to support myself I started living in the woods behind the hospital. Laying up against the tree holding the Card I had picked out for Clara I couldn’t help but replay that awful day in my mind. I can\\'t help but feel like she was just the beginning of something terrible. I have to stop him, I can\\'t let anyone else be the victim of that horrible smile.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 3}\n",

It is something magical, a bond that transcends the anonymity of security cameras. At first, it was just a silly idea. I was walking through the streets, seeing the round black glasses pointed from the corners. I wondered who was behind them, if anyone was watching me at that moment.\\n\\nThe first time was an accident. I wasn\\'t planning on killing anyone, but the old man who ran the newsstand was so easy to hate. He yelled at the children, insulted the elderly, and once spat at me for not buying anything. One night, I followed him to his house, a small cabin on the outskirts of town. There were no cameras there, but as I tightened my hands around his neck and felt the life drain from his eyes, I thought of all the cameras that had captured our walk to that place.\\n\\nThe next day, I walked past one of those cameras. I stopped, looked directly into the lens and smiled. That smile wasn\\'t for me. It was for whoever was watching, whoever took the time to observe a nobody like me.\\n\\nThe adrenaline was addictive. After that, I started planning. I chose my victims carefully, people who, in my opinion, did not deserve to be alive. The guy who beat his wife in the supermarket. The woman who left her dog tied up in the rain. He followed them, studied them and, when the time came, he acted. I always made sure to pass at least one camera before and after, leaving my signature: a wide, almost manic smile that said, “I know you\\'re watching me.”\\n\\nOver time, things got complicated. The cameras stopped being just spectators and became part of my process. I started picking places where I knew they would be, making sure everything was recorded. I even developed a little ritual: after the act, I would return to the nearest camera spot, look directly into the lens, and whisper, \"Thank you for watching.\"\\n\\nBut one day, something changed.\\n\\nShe had just broken up with a man who drove drunk every night. I followed him to an underground parking lot, dragged him behind a pillar, and left him there. As I turned toward one of the cameras for my usual smile, I felt something strange. A chill ran down my spine. It was as if the lens was looking at me, not as an inert object, but as something alive.\\n\\nThat night, I checked my computer and found something even more disturbing. Every time I searched for camera footage online, there was a figure in the background of the shots. A barely visible shadow, always in the moments when I smiled. I thought it was a glitch in the system, something to do with the quality of the recording. But the figure was getting closer, more and more defined.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t long before the shadow began to appear in my real life. No matter where I was, I could feel eyes staring at me, eyes that didn\\'t belong to any human being. And yet I couldn\\'t stop. The idea that someone – or something – was always watching me pushed me to continue.\\n\\nThe last time I smiled in front of a camera was different. It was a rainy night, and I had just finished up with a man who abandoned his mother in a nursing home. I approached the camera and smiled, but this time, the shadow was not in the background. It was right behind me, reflected in the glass of the lens.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what it was, but I know it\\'s waiting for me. And now, when I walk in front of a camera, I no longer smile for those who are watching me.

I gestured for them to follow me to the living room, where Lois and Jared were chatting. Their attention quickly snapped to the gift in my hands.\\n\\n\"Oh shit, you didn\\'t say there was a gift exchange,\" Jared gasped. I shook my head.\\n\\n\"Nah, there isn\\'t. Matt jumped the gun, which is great, and I wanna open it with everyone here!\" I announced.\\n\\nLois locked eyes with the couple, \"Is it *that* thing?\"\\n\\nChloe nodded. Lois began bouncing in her seat like an excited child. I knew Lois and Chloe were nigh-inseparable best friends, so I figured she\\'d be in the know about what I was about to receive.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve had the gift in your hands for like two minutes aren\\'t you gonna open it?\" Noah laughed. All eyes were on me. Despite the surprise, I felt honoured. I felt loved.\\n\\nI tore the wrapping paper off, and inside was something I was very familiar with. A book. A large book at that.\\n\\n\"Merry Christmas!\" Matt cheered. I was entranced by what I was holding, studying the cover.\\n\\nThe book was a dark red, hard cover that looked quite old. It had ridges on the cover that almost resembled the pattern of a skull. I noticed it had no title on the front, nor on the spine. What\\'s more, the book almost felt as if it was generating a small amount of heat. The more I inspected the outside, the more unsettled I got.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t say I\\'ve ever had anything like this before,\" I said. \"Thanks, guys!\"\\n\\nI gave Matt and Chloe a hug, still holding onto the book.\\n\\n\"You like to read, and you\\'re really into that spooky shit so I figured this would be perfect for you,\" Chloe explained.\\n\\n\"The guy at the shop said it\\'d freak out anybody,\" Lois chimed in.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll have to check it out on my down time. I don\\'t wanna interrupt the party we got going.\" I said, beginning to pace towards my room. \"I\\'ll just stick it on the ol\\' reliable shelf here.\"\\n\\n\"Whoa whoa, now, you gotta read some of it,\" Jared insisted. \"Can\\'t just put a gift away without using it!\" Everyone seemed to rally behind his words. They all began chanting \"read it\" over and over. I love reading, it\\'s my jam. It\\'s also something I usually do alone.\\n\\n\"Screw it,\" I said. \"Let\\'s get it.\"\\n\\nI sat in the centre of the couch, with everyone crowding around me. I was a teacher reading to the class. I opened the book and felt a waft of warm air hit my face. I checked to see if anyone noticed, but maybe they were too buzzed to care. The text was...almost complete gibberish. I tried my best to read along with it for the first page. We definitely had a few laughs, and nothing felt scary whatsoever.\\n\\nEventually, something unsettling came at the next page.\\n\\n\"Ji..nu...jo...ack..tos...hold up,\" I said, observing the next phrase. It was actual English.\\n\\n\"Upon thy next waking the gates will open.\"\\n\\nSomething felt off, but hey, this was an ominous spooky book; and it was succeeding in making me nervous. I paused, looking at everybody.\\n\\n\"You alright?\" Noah asked me.\\n\\n\"That was creepy...\" I could only answer. \"Like actually creepy.\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s a good gift, right?\" Matt asked.\\n\\n\"Keep going if you want to, man,\" Jared offered, though I could tell he was somewhat nervous. \"No pressure, we might be getting to the actual good part.\"\\n\\nI gave it some thought, and eventually chalked up my nervousness to my alcohol consumption. I mean it was just a damn book. I huffed and together we kept attempting to speak through the gibberish that followed. Eventually we came upon more legible words:\\n\\n\"In where I\\'m found, thy key is given.\"\\n\\nI felt my nerves go away, seeing everyone else so calm. The novelty of reading through gibberish was wearing off so I opted for one more page.\\n\\n\"And to return, thou must visit a shattered soul.\"\\n\\nI closed the book, deciding that was enough reading for now. We wrapped up the night not long after some party games. Everyone excluding myself was getting their shoes on and I was ready to lock the door as soon as the last guest left.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re still down for the theatre tomorrow?\" Noah asked me. \"We\\'re all gonna be there for 6:00pm\"\\n\\n\"Hell yeah I\\'ll be there,\" I assured him. I tightly hugged each guest tightly before they departed from my apartment. I got texts from all except Chloe (who was with Matt anyway) saying that they got home safe. I cleaned up a little, fit my new, creepy book on my bookshelf, and flopped onto my bed. The thoughts of gratitude for friendship entered my mind and lulled me to sleep.\\n\\nThe next morning I was awoken by my apartment shaking. I jolted up, expecting everything in my room to fall down on me. The shaking subsided, and that\\'s when I noticed something even stranger. There looked to be soot and dust particles in the air. I inhaled, it did smell like there was a fire nearby. I thought perhaps I left my window open and a nearby fire blew all it\\'s residue into my room.\\n\\nWhen I went to check my window to see if my window was open I realized it was pitch black outside. Did I wake up in the early hours of the morning? I shuffled around my nightstand in the dark until I found my phone. I saw the time before my phone abruptly shut down: 4:14pm! Why on earth was it pitch black out!?\\n\\nI got dressed and went to turn on my lights. No power. Explains why my phone may have died, too. I presumed that something electrical caught fire and forced my apartment into a blackout. I went to the bathroom to turn on the tap. I was greeted with a black sludge spewing from the tap. I quickly shut it off. I must\\'ve been dreaming the whole thing, surely. Did that weird book give me nightmares or something? When do I wake up? That question sprung an idea into my head.\\n\\nI navigated around in the dark until I found a lighter, igniting the only candle in my household. The coconut and vanilla scented candle feebly attempted to combat the smoky stench in the apartment, but I was more grateful for the light. Something caught my eye while I was pacing around the room:\\n\\nThe book was missing from the shelf.\\n\\n\"Oh, crap,\" I muttered to myself.\\n\\nI decided I needed to get the hell out of my apartment and see where all the inconveniences were coming from. If this was a dream, maybe leaving my place was the remedy I needed to wake back up. Who knows what I\\'d see out there, though.\\n\\nTo no surprise, there was no light in the apartment building. The once quaint, warm hallway leading to the stairwell was dark and smoggy. I managed to traverse the stairwell in the dark. Once I reached the bottom of the stairs there was a glaring issue with the door to the outside. There was no real way of saying it normally.\\n\\nThe cover of the book had taken over the doorway to the outside. I recognized the color and ridges even in the darkness. It creaked like nails on a chalkboard. It began opening on its own, beckoning me to come outside.\\n\\n\"Just a dream, just a dream,\" I whispered to myself, hoping I was right. I jogged outside, thinking I\\'d  wake up breathing fresh air, and seeing the sun shine in my room.\\n\\nI was wrong.\\n\\nIt looked like I\\'d stepped outside at four in the morning. The trees outside the apartment that had already lost their leaves, looked shrivelled and choked. The outside of the apartment had paint peeling from the outer siding. There didn\\'t appear to be any fire nearby, only a thick darkness that felt like something forced nighttime to be even more absent of light.\\n\\nStars didn\\'t shine, clouds weren\\'t present, and the humming of vehicles humming on the highway not far from me were gone. There was only one source of \"light;\" red streaks that tore into the sky like an open wound. It was dim, though as my eyes adjusted I could see the hue form on my body.\\n\\nI was beginning to panic, my mind would\\'ve snapped me out of this state by now. I scrambled for my car keys. I wasn\\'t going to stick around if I could find a better place to be. Jared lived closest to me, a two minute car ride or a fifteen minute walk. I figured he\\'d be up.\\n\\nWhen I looked up after snagging my keys I noticed that all the cars, including mine, were melting husks of metal. I dropped my keys and stared at the molten blob that used to be my Lexus. I\\'d saved for almost two years to buy it, too!\\n\\nAs I yelled in frustration, I heard slow footsteps from my left. I snapped my head in that direction and came across a familiar sight. My elderly neighbour, Doris, who lived a few suites down from me. She stared sheepishly at me.\\n\\n\"Doris! Do you see this shit? What\\'s going on!?\" I demanded. Her expression didn\\'t change much.\\n\\n\"The times are always changing for the worst, aren\\'t they?\" she nonchalantly replied. It was a bit out of character but then again I also was screaming damn near at the top of my lungs.  She turned around to go back inside, and I let out a small shout at what I saw.\\n\\nThe whole back of her body had been cut out. I could see what was left of her brain. I could see her exposed lungs expanding and contracting in short, hurried breaths. She was moving as if nothing was the matter. I couldn\\'t find the words, I was far too choked. Then I sprinted.\\n\\nI could feel the tears of fright run down my face as I sprinted to Jared\\'s. I was praying he was home. There was a thickness in the air that was causing me to run out of energy fast. I stopped a few times to take breathers. I noticed almost every building was decaying just like my apartment. I was fortunate that I didn\\'t see anybody else out at this time. Considering how my neighbour was, I was grateful.\\n\\nI rounded the bend towards Jared\\'s street. I wasn\\'t far, only one last sprint to go. Something made me halt my stride, however.\\n\\nI saw two people, if I could call them that. They looked like a mid-twenties couple. Nothing freakishly off about them. The man had a buzzcut that was thoroughly blended into his beard. The woman had bright, blonde hair. They both wore dark clothing. They were on a rotting porch attached to an equally rotting house. They were ahead to my left, the next house up. \\n\\nI resisted the urge to call out to them. My intentions were simply to slink on by as if nothing happened. I quietly speed walked by, seeing them in my peripherals as I made my way closer to Jared\\'s. \\n\\n\"What is this?\" I heard the man ask aloud. \\n\\n\"Did you want to come inside? We just finished preparing the place,\" the woman chimed in.\\n\\nI froze for a second, doing a quick take at them to see if they were looking at me. Indeed they were. Their eyes were uncanny, placed far too apart on their faces. Their smiles were inviting, but unsettlingly wide. \\n\\nBefore I could even answer them, the man gouged out his partner\\'s eye with his thumb. I could hear the squishing and popping from where I was. She chuckled, doing the same to him. I was paralyzed with dread as the couple literally began to tear each other\\'s faces apart. \\n\\nAdrenaline urged me to run, and I was reaching Jared\\'s fast. If this was a dream, I think I\\'d have woken up by now. \\n\\nI finally got to Jared\\'s place. The large property was looking rough, but still graceful despite the hellish conditions. I noticed something different about his place in comparison to the others: the windows had been boarded up. That filled me with hope, perhaps he was in there. If he was fortifying the place, then that means he probably wasn\\'t as crazy and demonic as the people I\\'d encountered. \\n\\nI tried the doorbell, but it had been disabled. I began frantically pounding on the door.\\n\\n\"Jared! Jared, are you home!?\" I pleaded, hoping for a response. \\n\\nI heard something move inside the house. \\n\\nThe mail slot on the door swung open and I saw the barrel of a gun poking out, striking me in the side of the head. \\n\\n\"Jared! What\\'re you doing!? It\\'s me, Marshall!\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re the fourth \\'Marshall\\' I\\'ve seen this week! You\\'re not fooling me!\" I heard Jared\\'s voice boom from behind the door.\\n\\nThis week? I\\'d just woken up in this nightmare and he\\'d been here for over a goddamn week?\\n\\n\"Jared, I\\'m unbelievably terrified, and if what you\\'re saying is true then I\\'m so sorry you\\'re in this situation!,\" I cried. \"I\\'ve known you for almost ten years, you gotta trust me!\"\\n\\nThere was a pause, as if Jared was thinking hard about what to say next. I slumped myself away from the door, so my close friend wouldn\\'t blindly kill me. \\n\\n\"The other ones claimed to know me too! Just leave me alone!\"\\n\\nWhy wasn\\'t he coming out to confront me? If I was some sort of imposter creature, wouldn\\'t he just kill me here and now? He had a gun to my head a second ago. I thought about it, maybe he was scared. Maybe the things didn\\'t quite know everything about him...\\n\\n\"Breaking up with Lizzy did a number on you! You always get extra pearls and less sugar in your bubble tea! Your favourite show is-\" \\n\\nThe door swung open, revealing my dear friend Jared standing with a hunting rifle. He took a few inspecting glances at me before ushering me inside. I gave him a big hug of relief, and he reciprocated. He inspected me after he closed the door.\\n\\n\"You said there was multiple of...me?\" I asked.\\n\\n  \\n\"Almost looked like you, too,\" Jared sighed. \"Except the faces were wrong, and one of them had missing parts of their bodies...\" \\n\\nJared shuddered at the thoughts of them. Jared had candles lit\\n\\nThe inside of his place stunk, a stark contrast to the pristine conditions he\\'d kept them in before. The candles didn\\'t help at all. \\n\\n\"Are your parents here, too?\" I asked. Jared frowned. \\n\\n\"In the basement, under the sheets. They\\'re difficult to miss\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m...I\\'m so sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Your family, you hear from them lately?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t say I have...\" I muttered. \"Haven\\'t been bothered to check in years. Moved across the country to get away from them, and in this shit-fest we\\'re in I wanted to find you guys first.\"\\n\\nJared nodded in approval. \\n\\n\"I think we should find the others,\" I declared. \\n\\n\"You realize they\\'re all on the other side of the city, right? You and I are safe here,\" Jared challenged. \\n\\n\"But the theatre isn\\'t,\" I snapped back. \"Maybe they\\'re there, they could be in trouble.\"\\n\\nJared pondered a little, before a lightbulb idea dawned onto him. \"You remember anything from that book you read?\" \\n\\n\"You think it\\'s got something to do with this situation too, hey?\" I asked, partially reassured. \\n\\n\"I saw it earlier...the markings and text were written all over my home and then...I was here,\" he explained. Similar experience to myself. \\n\\n\"Upon thy next waking the gates will open,\" I recited. The house began shaking for a brief moment. It was as if the universe was listening to me. \\n\\n\"What was the next part?\" Jared asked, almost excitedly.\\n\\n\"In where I\\'m found, thy key is given..?\" I kept recalling the phrases I understood. The house shook again.\\n\\n\"I\\'m gonna bring your place down if I keep talking about it,\" I said, nervously. \"In where I\\'m found...hmmm.\"\\n\\nAn idea dawned on me. \"You got any idea where Matt and Chloe got that book?\" \\n\\nJared nodded, \"The bookstore in Lowground Mall...\"\\n\\n\"...Which is attached to the theatre!\"\\n\\nWith any luck, we\\'d be able to venture to Lowground Mall in roughly an hour and a half on foot. I fitted myself with a couple of makeshift clubs that Jared had built. Nothing had outright attacked me, yet, but I wasn\\'t counting on everything in this plane of existence to be neutral at best. I was banking on our friend\\'s loyalty to be unwavering, and that they\\'d do anything to meet us there. \\n\\n\"That key had better be going through this hell to get through,\" I hissed, stepping outside. \\n\\nOur destination was set, the theatre attached to Lowground Mall. Plans were still on for today, it seemed.  \\n\\nJared had pocketed as much ammunition as he possibly could. He must\\'ve seen some terrible things if his first reaction was to shoot. \\n\\n\"Ready?\" I asked. \\n\\n\"Ready,\" Jared answered.\\n\\nWe managed to get through our community without seeing any creature. It was much of the repeated destruction carried through the city. Something new was coming, however.\\n\\nWind. A squall of wind blew at Jared and I, knocking us off balance. The force nearly toppled us, as it bent away at the rotting housing and trees. It was hot, and smelled of death. I looked back at Jared to make sure he was good. After getting back upright, he confirmed he was ok. \\n\\nThere was a pause, then the wind blasted us again. Something was different about this squall, however. \\n\\nCarried in the wind was a distressing yet familiar cacophony of screams:\\n\\nMatt\\'s and Chloe\\'s. ', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 9}\n",

', 'author': Redditor(name='Applied_logistics'), 'subreddit_name': 'nosleep', 'content': \"There is no way to pace this story. Because my recollection of the event is like any other truly violent one, chaotic and instantaneous. None of lives tragic moments are long buildups to skilfully told releases, they are disorientatingly fleeting, only properly understood with hindsight. But I think the retelling is important. If only to remember what happened.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI am an electrician with a engineering degree. My father had a passion for boats and so naturally I spent some time in the navy. Although I learned much it is only important in so far as telling you that **I** was very qualified for my job. I worked on a cargo ship. That work was a very lonely existence. Hard to keep onto people when you are off shore for long stretches of time, especially women. I had a highschool sweetheart, and I spent time dating after we broke up. But no one could stomach my proffession, and having me in exile so consistently. So I make due with my own company. Sure when you are at sea you make friends for life, no way you can’t under those circumstanses. The thing is just that most of these friends for life, you won’t ever see again. Everyone takes jobs when they can, and that means spending a lot of time on the same ship with different men. The men with families plan their scheduals around those families, staying true to whats important to them. And therefore often fly home when we port. It is different when you are a single man. Work can become an escape from your life. It can keep your mind off the things you really need, keep you from improving, from finding solutions, making changes. It can ocupy your mind even if that mind hungers desperately for change, seeking anything but that horrible doomed loneliness at sea. Still the work makes you stay, it takes away the energy you need to wonder, and find better things.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe work that consumed my time on the waters was relativly simple. I did maintenance. Specifically for the stuff that had to work. Lights, sensors, engine control and so on. Anything where you would think an electrical signal resultet in the mechanical change of a system, I was the man you talked to. That made days simple, I had one tool that was always with me, a voltmeter. Wondering if current is passing through this wire? Simple as connecting to it and you will know. Making my rounds around the ship this way checking this and that, I was constantly running into the entire crew. We all knew each other well after no time at all, but from the perspective of others I get why I was always greeted with surprise. I knew where they where stationed, but they knew little of my rounds, or didn’t care to.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Hey Jim! Finding it hard to stay away from me?”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIt was Mark. Basically the only part of the crew I knew from earlier. He was such a lovely man. Kind hearted, helpful, understanding and full of playfull humor.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Of cause, you’re magnetic.” I held up my voltmeter like it was dragging me to him.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nHe gave out a small snicker.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“What’s wrong with our ship today?” No one liked Justin. Not sure why. Maybe it was because he forced himself into stuff people weren’t interested in sharing with him. Or maybe it was just me, and I despised the fact he didn’t understand I wasn’t interested in having mine and Marks friendly jester bouts interposed with generic small talk. I had a fleeting thought occur to me then, of replying “you are the problem with our ship” but kept it to my self.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“As usual it’s just lose signals that are being tightened up. But you should be glad I’m not letting anyone in on how shitty our sonar is!”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAll ships have a sonar that helps measure the depth to the seafloor. It isn’t really useful when your at the middle of the ocean, like we where at this time. But it can be extraordinarily important when close to shore. And if you are like most normal people you probably havn’t thought about how a sound based system knows what is underneath you and what is at the sides of you. After all it is a wave that just propagates out to all sides, so how would you know what the echo was bounced of off?\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe reason why it works is answered by how it sounds. Multiple wavelengths of sound are emitted at once. The waves flow over each other creating interference. The image is then created by how these waves have changed when they come back. The waves spread out in 3d, and when the sound is bounced of an object all of the components, with different wavelenghts, are shifted in relation to each other. Where there once was negativ interferance there is now positive, and maybe, vice versa. Allowing you with some math to know what direction the return signal is coming from. Interferance like this is crazy complecated.\\n\\nWhen interference is between two waves in head on collision it is relatively easy to understand. But when waves can spread between each other in 3d, or even 2d surfaces like an ocean, it immediately becomes very hard to grasp how they interact. But this complicated interaction is why sonar works, and simultaneously why ours wasn’t always able too.\\n\\nBecause in some cases different wavelengths interact in such an unfortunate manner as to create spots of hyper enlarged magnitudes. Basically a single spot can be placed in a location where all waves peak together, right at that same intersection spot. Creating a wave of such intensity that it can fry the system, simply by being literal hundreds of times bigger than the equipment was ever designed to withstand. A rogue wave, as it is called. And it just so happens that our sonar has a tendency to create such waves much more frequently than you would expect.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Let me guess, it’s so bad as to basically be like going in blind?” I din’t answer Justin this time. Just looked at Mark as I went by them onto the next task.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Don’t have to much fun without me now” I didn’t pity Mark having to stay with Justin.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThat evening we were all called in to eat together, which was a rare event. The captain chose to give us some bad news, in a nice setting. Not that the room was nice, just that company was. Imagine a ship and you will know what it looked like. Cramped, iron walls spray-painted with a thick layer of white-ish paint, fluorescent lights, tables mounted to the floor the feeling was like you had chosen to live with 15 other men in a floating prison. What a brutal proffesion.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“okay, so. SO WE are about a couple of days. A day or two out from really bad winds.” We all knew what that meant, even if his look hadn’t been so stern. Our captain was a man with many many years of expertise. That he even called a meeting meant this was critical information. And getting a wind warning out on sea, didn’t mean strong winds. It meant waves.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“and of cause that means dangerous waters” The weight of his words draped over us like a duvet. Just like any slumber party anything outside of it became a distant reality.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI broke the silence\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“How tall are we expecting them?” The captain turned his eyes to meet mine.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“The important thing is that we prepare for it, that’s the only focus at this point. Everybody on board with that assessment?” He turned his gaze towards the room. He didn’t know the answer, which was frightening.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“sounds good cap” A few of the men said uncoordinatedly. Allowing his desperate plea to let his ignorance slip under the rug.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThat night I dreamt terrible things. I dreamt that all of us was in the lifeboat. The ship slowly taking on water, we had managed to make an escape. But the lifeboat wouldn’t unlatch. With such a technical fault, I dreamt of the men arguing, to some degree violently. They where choosing a crew-member to unlatch it from the outside. Staying back with the cargo on the doomed vessel. And logically, at least to my dreaming mind, they chose me. I was the only one that knew how to operate the latching mechanism. And being forced to step out from the security of the life boat I watched Mark fight back against the group consensus. Landing backwards on the though metal of the cargo ship, I watched the men that threw me give way to an enourmous version of Marks head. Marks head filling the entire doorway with his big teary eyes. As the ship started listing I got to my feet, a new directive being installed into my being. Survival was no longer an option. Only the ability to save my tribe remained. Saving Mark. Dreams are weird conglamerations of ideas. And I don’t know if we hugged but we deffinitly exchanged a deepfelt goodbye. And I grabed the small pin keeping me from ridding the boats of shackles. Pushing it of the ship I watched as I was ripped from exsistence by my own heroism.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“You slept okay Jim?” Mark handed me a much needed coffee. Even if I had slept well I wouldn’t have been able to make coffee in this sea. Contrary to common belief a ship doesn’t sway every which way. The ship is most well equipped going straight onto the waves. The captain going in head on to the waves meant you could be pretty sure what ways you would be thrown. Although the sea wasn’t bad enough to throw us yet. But you could feel the winds the captain had promised, had worse in store for us when we reached them. I accepted the coffee graciously.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“thank you” a small smile towards him was unwillingly given off my lips.\\n\\n“well I actually slept quite poorly.” I directed my following inquiry to the entire room.\\n\\n“does anyone here know how to keep the lifeboat clamps engaged?” The question was vague. I designed it that way. Such that it would only get a reply from someone I could trust with the task.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Yes sure why? Anything wrong with the controls?” This was my guy. A man named Joshua.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“No not necessarily, I just havn’t gotten around to check the circuitry is all. I need a hand with keeping the boat on tight whilst im in there. You have time?” Mark let off a smirk.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“arrhh” He muttered whilst bringing back my attention to him.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Sure, holla when you need me.” After Joshua’s affirmation I returned to Mark with a disapproving look.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Grab a jacket Joshua, it’s getting cramped in here.” Mark’s smirk disappeared.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMaking our way outside wasn’t as bad as I had expected, yet not easy. The waves at this point being no more than an omen of the storm to come. Only the swinging oceanic vibrations, manifesting in the waves we now felt, had been able to travel far enough to reach us. The problem was that the seemingly random intervals between the waves made it hard to discern a pattern to the swaying they created. When walking you ended up having little indication of when they would hit. And looking out over the water the only regularity I could discern to their motion was their direction.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe lifeboat hang at a fortfive degree angle of the side of the ship. It Was orange. And it was very awkward to get into. I stepped up next to it with Joshua.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Know what to do?”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Yes sir” Joshua answered sarcastically. I waited for another respons. He didn’t get the hint.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“yes sir” he repeated. Now with obedience.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“And what are you doing?” He had a look of embarrassment on his face, as he understood what I had meant all along.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“I’ll be standing here holding onto the release, stopping the pin from disengaging.” I nodded.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Great thank you Joshua.” With our roles defined I moved into the small canister.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTaking a hand to the top of the door I put my foot onto the sloped floor. What a terrible design choice this was. Ducking into it I used one hand to grab seats on the way down to the control panel, the other hand tightly gripping my trusty voltmeter. Each step into the maw of it my movement became more and more fluid, whilst my anxiety in turn grew worse and worse.\\n\\nAs I came closer to its control panel, I could see more and more ocean through the tiny, enforced windows. The waves were scattered across the ocean, like an ill commanded army their power was laughable. Given proper coordination they would have been capable of much greater feats than putting us of balance. I sat myself in the captain’s chair of the small tin.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Joshua you there?” I spoke with more nervousness that I thought I would. I wasn’t afraid of falling into the water. I was afraid the boat would fall into the water. Sure, I could get back on the ship. But the boat. Our only safety would be lost forever.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Yes, I’m here. Holding the release pin. You are clear.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI popped the control panel. I looked for the wire that connected to the release button. It was in a cluster of wires that went to the door. This system had plenty of redundancy. Which was good, and unexpected honestly. Looks like my nightmare was unsubstantiated. But not checking the signal now would be silly. I placed my voltmeter on my lap and removed one of the measuring clamps. Slowly I extended my hand and put the clamp to just one of the release wires. Once in place I retracted my hand and went for the next clamp on the device. Reaching forward I put the other clamp on the same wire, completing the circuit.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Pressing release.” I warned Joshua.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“You are clear.” Joshua replied.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI pressed the button. It lit up green. My voltmeter spiked. The mechanism worked. There was no movement. Relief.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Okay yeah I felt it kick, what a kick, it works alright!” The powerful joy in his last affirmation was exactly what I needed.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Perfect. Thank You Joshua, I’m packing up in hear you can relax again.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nLeaning down I went to take away one of the clamps. But Joshua interrupted me.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n“Oh MY GOD. JIM; JIIIM”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI looked out the small window in front of me. The ocean was full of smaller yet dangerous waves travelling incoherently. But a pattern had emerged from their movement. And one peak had formed to such enormous mass that it began towering over the ship. We were going to get hit. And the ship would not be able to handle it. I went into shock. Everything slowed down. Watching that wave grow. Every gut-wrenching moment vividly detailed.\\n\\nFirst was the rain. The wind blew of the water from it and showered the ship. This is when I remember the horn sounding. A useless attempt at a warning. The next I remember was feeling our enormous cargo ship being lifted out of the water with a dizzying speed and ease. The rogue wave rolling us over. I felt my body being accelerated by gravity with my back first into the seat, a direction I hadn’t expected gravity to pull. Looking back towards Joshua I hoped he had made it into the lifeboat with me. Only to see him being swept of his feet plummeting toward a background of blue, that I couldn’t determine if was ocean or sky. Being snapped out of my catatonic state, I hammered my hand into the release button on the console. The next thing. Was the impact. First, I heard the sound of waves impact the cargo ship. It sounded like someone had pitch shifted the crumbling of an aluminum can. The sheer brutality of the sound a dire reminder of the frailty of steel. Then the lifeboat was sent to the heavens. This boat, which was designed to plummet into waters from great heights was dented by the force. I dare not imagine what had happened if the wave had collided with it in any other manner than head on. I was thrown out of my seat and only barely saved my head from colliding with the inside of the lifeboat by sacrificing an arm. The wrist of which was pulverised, the halfway point of the arm having bones rushing out the skin in feeble attempt to escape the rest of the massacre. Landing on the floor I felt the lifeboat accelerate upwards. Emerging from the waters I and it was sent airborne again. When it hit the water I came crashing to a halt on the floor.\\n\\nAbusing the adrenaline to ignore the pain, I scurried to get on my feet. I looked out the window for any signs of life. By some miracle I found it. A tiny spec of man was in the waters not that far from me.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIt was Joshua, but the wave had already claimed him. The impact of the water had mauled him worse than a big rig ever could. There was blood all around him, and I could only see one of his arms flailing in an attempt to help himself afloat. His movements looked like the spasms executed by a mechanical doll, preprogrammed and soulless. If He wasn’t already following gods light, the only humane thing was to let him. The Ship was gone. Only white foam on water and shifting waves remained on the sea. And as if someone had put the water underneath the vessel to a boil, air bubbles from the ship where rushing to the surface. The sheer volume of air the enormous exhalation from the cavities of the sinking iron long that I had called home, and that now others would find their grave. The thought that this air meant that Mark could be trapped in their. Still being in panic and falsely clinging onto hope deep beneath the ocean. The thought filled me with terror.\\n\\nI was watching a scene of complete erasure. No evidence left behind of the carnage that had taken so much from so many. And as a devilish answer to my newfound dispair, evidence was brought back from the deep. Crates of cargo started erupting up from the water. Like floats that had been submerged, their buoyancy lifted the crates so violently that they became airborne. Careening out of the water soaring into the skies. Their reentry into the waters defaced them to liken accordions by the force of it. As much as I could have risked searching for survivors, seeing 20 foot crates, tons of steel shot from the ocean, only to come hailing down again; I had to get away.\\n\\nStumbling to my feet I use my good arm to hoist me up on my feet. The waves where much harder to ignore now that the lifeboat itself was in the waters. What before had seemed like inconsequential currents of water now rooked me violently back and forth. It wasn't any longer a curtesy to hold onto the rows chairs, as I once again walked down towards the control panel. This time my other hand clutching only blood, air and my will to survive. \\n\\nReaching the control panel I used my good arm to do everything. And with the motor coming to life the lifeboat was inches from being hit by a crate shooting out of the waters. I gave her all she could muster, desperate to get away from here. But knowing fully well I was at the mercy of whatever direction that crate would come back down. It ended up slamming into the water on the other side of the boat. The crash against the water an ear deafening explosion, followed by the anguished cry of thick metal walls being bend out of shape. It had been filled with stuffed animals. Their inerts now flew out of the compressed crates perforated sides and covered my small windows in fluff and teddy bear gore. \\n\\nI was sailing blind. Only guided by the sounds of doom. Sounds that only way to slowly shifted from from around me, to besides me and finally to behind me. I had escaped.\\xa0\\n\\nDays later I was picked up as the only surviver. Many ships go down like this every year. Rogue waves are not a myth. They do happen. And you just have to pray, that it won’t be close to you.\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 26}\n",

The shortcut I was following had been a lifeline for me and my friends in better times—a hidden path winding through the dense trees, leading straight to the old bridge. We used to play soldiers here, using sticks for rifles and tin cans for grenades. Tommy’s uncle, a grizzled veteran, would regale us with tales of his time in the army, turning our games into a kind of boot camp.\\n\\nI paused, leaning against a tree as the weight of everything pressed down on me. How long had it been? How many hours have passed? I couldn’t be sure. My phone was dead, and the pitch-black sky showed no sign of dawn breaking anytime soon. It was fall, and the nights lingered longer, colder, and darker. The chill seeped through my soaked clothes, making me shiver as I gripped the revolver tightly in my hand.\\n\\nThat’s when I heard it—faint footsteps ahead. I froze, crouching low behind a cluster of bushes, my breath slowing. Squinting through the darkness, I spotted the figure of a man, silhouetted against the faint glow of a flashlight beam. It was an officer, clad in standard-issue gear and holding a rifle at the ready. My first instinct was relief—help, finally—but then I hesitated. My gut churned as I recalled the janitor’s cryptic warning.\\n\\nThe officer’s voice crackled through the silence, speaking into a walkie-talkie clipped to his shoulder. I couldn’t make out the words, but the tone was calm, almost casual. I watched closely as the officer turned slightly, revealing a youthful face. He looked barely older than me—early twenties at most.  A rookie, i guessed.\\n\\nHeart pounding, I decided I needed answers. If the janitor’s vague warnings had any truth to them, I couldn’t risk walking away. Gripping the revolver firmly, I began to move, inching forward as silently as I could. I avoided twigs and dry leaves, moving with a focus I didn’t know I possessed.\\n\\n“This is it“. I thought. “Play soldier.“\\n\\nWhen I was close enough, I stood upright and leveled the revolver at the back of the officer’s head. The click of the safety being pulled back broke the stillness like a thunderclap.\\n\\n\"Don’t move,\" I ordered.\\n\\nThe officer stiffened, his body going rigid. The flashlight fell to the ground, casting erratic beams of light across the forest floor.\\n\\n\"Tell your buddy on the walkie that everything’s fine,\" I demanded.\\n\\nThe walkie-talkie crackled again, a voice on the other end saying, \"Jay? You good?\"\\n\\nI pressed the barrel of the revolver against the back of the officer’s head, my grip tightening. \"Answer him,\" I hissed. \"Tell him you’re fine. Now.\"\\n\\nThe officer, his voice trembling, reached for the walkie-talkie slowly. \"I’m fine,\" he said, forcing steadiness into his tone. \"I thought I saw something. but all good.\"\\n\\nThe voice on the other end paused for a moment before replying, \"Copy that. Stay sharp boy.\" The line went silent\\n\\nI exhaled, my mind racing. \"Drop the rifle. Slowly.\"\\n\\nThe officer complied, lowering the rifle to the ground with deliberate care. I kicked it out of reach, my eyes never leaving him.\\n\\n\"What’s going on?\" I asked. \"What the hell is happening out here? Why is everything falling apart?\"\\n\\nThe officer turned his head slightly, enough for me to catch a glimpse of his pale, frightened face. \"I... I don’t know much,\" he stammered. \"I swear, man. I’m just following orders.\"\\n\\n\"What orders?\" I barked.\\n\\n\"They don’t tell us everything!\" the officer pleaded, his voice breaking. \"The mayor just told us to secure the area and to bring everyone to the safe zone. That’s all I know! I didn’t sign up for this—I just wanted to do my job. Now it’s all gone to hell.\" He swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. \"I want it to be over too, man. I swear.\"\\n\\nI stared at him, searching his face for any hint of deceit. The guy looked genuinely terrified, his fear mirroring my own. For a moment, the two of us stood in silence, the rain pattering softly around us.\\n\\nI lowered the revolver slightly, though I didn’t let my guard down. \"Alright\" I said finally. \"Just don’t tell on me“.\\n\\n\"Huh?“\\n\\nBefore the rookie could react, I swung the butt of the revolver, striking the side of his head. The officer crumpled to the ground with a soft groan. I crouched beside him, checking to make sure he was just unconscious. The guy was breathing steadily, though a welt was already forming where the revolver had struck.\\n\\nI grabbed the rifle and slung it over my shoulder. I picked up the walkie-talkie, hesitating for a moment as I considered whether it might lead to more trouble. Deciding it was worth the risk, I clipped it to my belt. Every tool counted now.\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” I said quietly, glancing down at the unconscious officer one last time. I then stepped over him and continued through the woods, moving swiftly but carefully.\\n\\nThe bridge wasn’t far now. I pushed forward, my mind set on reuniting with everyone—and on whatever answers lay ahead.\\n\\nI trudged down the muddy hill, my legs aching from exhaustion, the rifle slung over my shoulder weighing me down. The faint outline of the bridge appeared through the mist and rain, a small glimmer of hope. Relief began to seep into my tired muscles—but as I reached the bottom of the hill, the sight that greeted me, froze me in my tracks.\\n\\nMy friends were all on their knees, hands clasped tightly behind their heads. The school bus loomed behind them, its yellow frame streaked with dirt and rain. Two officers stood a few feet away, rifles slung across their backs, their voices raised in a heated argument that I couldn’t make out over the sound of the rain.\\n\\nMy eyes darted to Ashley. She was standing, her posture defiant, arms crossed over her chest as she faced the officers. Even from the distance, I could see her lips moving, arguing back, her voice cutting through the tension.\\n\\nI crouched low, my heart hammering as I observed the scene. What the hell was going on? I adjusted my grip on the rifle, creeping closer to get within earshot.\\n\\n“You don’t understand!” Ashley’s voice was fierce, her words sharp. “I need to speak with my dad. He’s the sheriff. He’ll tell you this is all a mistake.”\\n\\nOne of the officers, a burly man with a shaved head, shook his head firmly. “We’ve got orders to detain anyone we find. We’re not going to hurt you, Miss Prescott. Your father told us to keep you safe“.\\n\\nAshley’s voice rose, unwavering. “Keep me safe? I was home alone all night!“ I don’t believe a word you say!”\\n\\nI clenched my jaw, my blood boiling at the sight of everyone being helpless. I couldn’t stand by any longer. I reached for the walkie-talkie I had taken earlier. I pressed the button, keeping my voice low but firm, mimicking the officers’ tone.\\n\\n“Unit 4, we’ve got movement near the perimeter. Possible hostiles. Check it out ASAP.”\\n\\nI released the button, my voice echoing faintly from the other officers\\' radios. Both men stiffened, the one with his hand on his sidearm instinctively grabbing the device on his vest.\\n\\n“What the hell? That’s not from our unit,” he said, looking around sharply.\\n\\nI seized the moment of confusion. I raised the rifle, aiming for the more burly officer first. My hands were steady, fueled by desperation and determination. I fired, the sound cracking through the rain-soaked air. The shot hit the officer square in the shoulder, knocking him to the ground with a pained yell.\\n\\n“Get down!” I shouted to my friends, my voice cutting through the chaos.\\n\\nThe other officer whirled around, his rifle coming up, but I didn’t give him a chance. I fired again, this time grazing the man’s leg. The officer dropped his weapon, clutching his thigh as he fell to his knees.\\n\\nI sprinted down the hill, keeping the rifle aimed on the men. my friends scrambled to their feet, Kev and Tommy immediately rushing toward the dropped weapons.\\n\\n“Casey!” Demi cried, running towards me, her face a mix of relief and fear.\\n\\n“Not yet!” I barked, keeping my focus on the officers.\\n\\nThe injured officer groaned, glaring up at me. “You have no idea what you’re doing, kid.”\\n\\n“Yeah? Neither do you,” I spat, stepping back to join my friends as they armed themselves.\\n\\nThe second officer, raised a hand. “We didn’t want to hurt them, okay? We’re just following orders. You don’t understand—this isn’t what it looks like.”\\n\\n“Then make me understand.” I shouted back.\\n\\nThe officer opened his mouth but hesitated, his eyes darting to his partner. “It’s the mayor’s fault. That’s all I can say.”\\n\\nFor a moment, there was only the sound of the rain, when all of a sudden Greg grabbed the pistol from the officers’ holster.\\n\\n“Like hell that’s all you can say,” Greg snapped, pointing the sidearm at the officer.\\n\\n“Greg, stop!” Claire shouted, grabbing his arm. “We need to go. Now.”\\n\\nMy eyes flicked to the woods. The distant sound of groans and screeches carried on the wind, faint but unmistakable. Lurkers.\\n\\n“Let’s move,” I said firmly, pulling Demi along as we all hurried to the bus. I kept the rifle aimed at the officers as they backed away. Once everyone was on board, Greg floored the gas, the bus rumbling forward toward the bridge.\\n\\nThe school bus rumbled down the rain-slicked road, the interior lit faintly by the weak glow of overhead lights. Our group sat scattered across the seats, everyones faces marked with exhaustion and tension. I leaned back in my seat, Ashley sitting beside me with her head resting against my shoulder. The revolver I’d taken was tucked securely in my waistband, while the rifle rested on the seat next to me.\\n\\n“So,” Kev broke the silence, looking over at me, “what the hell happened while you were off playing action hero?”\\n\\nI rubbed the back of my neck, trying to organize my thoughts. “I ran through the woods, made it to the power plant, and managed to distract the Lurkers enough to double back and make a break for the bridge.”\\n\\n“Lurkers in the rain,” Tommy muttered. “Sounds like a movie title.”\\n\\nI shook my head. “Wasn’t as fun as it sounds. Anyway, I ran into this rookie cop near the bridge. He was talking to someone on a walkie-talkie, and it sounded like... I don’t know, like they were working together to round people up. He didn’t know much, but he mentioned they were supposed to bring everyone to a ‘safe zone.’ He didn’t say where, though.”\\n\\n“Safe zone?” Claire leaned forward. “What does that even mean? Are they trying to help people or—”\\n\\n“Control them,” Demi interjected, her tone grim. “They had us all on our knees with guns pointed at us. That doesn’t scream ‘safe’”\\n\\nGreg nodded, gripping the steering wheel tightly as he kept his eyes on the road. “When they stopped us, they kept going on about orders. They didn’t even tell us where they were taking us. Just that we had to comply.”\\n\\n“And you?” I glanced at Ashley.\\n\\nAshley straightened up, her voice calm but firm. “They said they wouldn’t hurt me because of my dad. But when I pushed them to let all of us go, they just dodged the question. It’s like they were scared of disobeying orders.”\\n\\nWe all fell into a brief silence, the weight of the mayor’s involvement sinking in.\\n\\n“It all comes back to that house,” Wes finally said, his voice tense. “Why did everything start there? And what exactly happened on the third floor?”\\n\\n“Not to mention our parents,” Claire said softly. “No one’s been able to reach them, except for Tommy’s uncle. And my mom isn’t exactly the type to just disappear.”\\n\\nTommy crossed his arms, staring at the floor of the bus. “My uncle’s the only one who ever had beef with the mayor. Always told me the guy was bad news, but he never really got into why. Just that he hated him enough to leave town and hole up on the farm after my aunt passed. Maybe he knows something.”\\n\\n“We’re sure as hell about to find out,” I said, glancing at Greg. “How much further?”\\n\\n“Not long now,” he replied, his knuckles white as he gripped the wheel.\\n\\nThe tension in the bus lifted slightly as Kev leaned back and cracked a grin. “Well this sure beats sitting in a basement all day. I feel like we’re in some netflix apocalypse movie.”\\n\\nTommy smirked. “Yeah, ‘Apocalypse High.’ Starring us as the unlucky seniors who just wanted to graduate.”\\n\\n“Can we not jinx it?” Claire muttered, rolling her eyes but smiling faintly.\\n\\n“You know what’s missing?” Wes said, leaning back in his seat. “A good soundtrack. Somebody grab their phone and play something.”\\n\\n“Wes, the world’s ending. Priorities,” Demi quipped, though she let out a small laugh.\\n\\nThe banter, however brief, helped ease the tension as the bus continued its trek down the winding road. The jokes faded as the lights of Tommy’s uncle’s farm came into view, the large house and barn silhouetted against the faint glow of the horizon.\\n\\nGreg slowed the bus, pulling it to a stop near the driveway. Tommy stood up and grabbed his rifle from his seat. “Alright, let’s see if Uncle Dale is ready to share some secrets. I hope he’s alright”\\n\\nWe climbed off the bus, our shoes crunching against the gravel as we approached the front door. I took a deep breath, looking around the eerily quiet farm, and prepared myself for what we might uncover.\\n\\nTommy rapped his knuckles against the weathered wooden door, we heard the shuffling of feet inside before a gruff voice called out.\\n\\n“Who’s there?”\\n\\n“It’s me, Uncle Dale. It’s Tommy,” he replied, his voice firm but edged with urgency.\\n\\nThe door cracked open, revealing Uncle Dale standing there with his shotgun. His eyes flicked over us, taking in our weary faces and muddied clothes. “Well, I’ll be damned,” he muttered. “Get in here before you freeze.”\\n\\nHe swung the door wide, letting us file into the warm, dimly lit living room. The smell of stew lingered in the air, and a fire crackled in the hearth. Uncle Dale motioned toward the dining table, where a pot of food and a loaf of bread sat. “Y’all look like you’ve been through hell. Grab a bowl. Help yourselves to anything in the fridge, too. Make yourselves comfortable.”\\n\\nWe all sat down, hesitant at first but grateful for the warmth and sustenance. Uncle Dale leaned against the wall, his shotgun resting by his side, watching us. He seemed calm, almost oblivious to the storm raging in our hearts and minds.\\n\\nTommy started to explain everything we’d been through, his voice steady but tinged with fatigue. “It all started at that party apparently. Everything seemed fine until… well, it wasn’t.”\\n\\nDemi chimed in, her tone more direct. “We were inside that creepy looking house when people turned into something else. We saw it happen. One second, they were normal—then black veins, glowing eyes, claws. We’ve been calling them Lurkers.”\\n\\nUncle Dale shifted uncomfortably but said nothing, letting us continue.\\n\\nKev, poking at his stew with his fork, added, “It’s not just that. It’s like the whole town just... went dark. Phones barely work. Roads are trashed. We’ve seen wrecked cars, abandoned houses. And these Lurkers—they keep coming, but they’re changing. They’re getting worse.”\\n\\nTommy looked at his uncle, his expression almost pleading. “We’ve been running and fighting all night. We barely made it here. Uncle Dale, you know what’s going on, please tell us.”\\n\\nUncle Dale took a deep breath, his hand tightening on the doorframe. “Eat up,” he said gruffly. “Get some rest. I’ll explain.”\\n\\nWe all exchanged uneasy glances but followed his advice. For a few moments, the only sound was the clinking of silverware and the soft hum of the rain outside.\\n\\nOnce we all settled, Uncle Dale finally spoke, his voice low and almost hesitant.\\n\\n“I’ve dreaded this day. I knew it would eventually come.” He shook his head, as if trying to push away the weight of his thoughts.\\n\\n“You kids deserve to know the truth. Even if it’s the last thing you’ll want to hear.”\\n\\nThe room went still.\\n\\n“You know the mayor of Clearbrook and I, Henry Cain… we grew up together. We were like brothers back then, running through these woods, getting into trouble. His family was always well-off, a big name in this town long before Henry became mayor. The creepy house you metioned? That was their family home, standing tall and eerie even back then. I never liked going there. Not because of their Rottweiler or the fact that his mother wouldn’t let us drink soda… it was because of Lydia.”\\n\\n“Lydia?” Tommy asked, breaking the silence.\\n\\n“Henry’s grandmother,” Uncle Dale replied. “She wasn’t just mean; she was something else entirely. The kind of woman who could freeze your soul with a glance. Always hunched over, muttering things under her breath, stuff you couldn’t understand. She’d have these fits—start shouting, breaking things. But it wasn’t just her temper. It was the way she looked at you… like she was studying you, deciding something about you. And then there were the rumors.”\\n\\n“Rumors?” I pressed.\\n\\n“People said Lydia had been old for as long as anyone could remember. Like she didn’t age the way normal folks did. But back then, folks were superstitious, always talking nonsense about witches and curses. I didn’t think much of it, not until years later.”\\n\\n“It was a night just like this,” he began, his voice low and steady. “Rain pouring down, thunder rumbling in the distance. I was about your age, Tommy. Just a dumb kid who thought the scariest thing in the world was a big spider. I didn’t know any better.”\\n\\nHe paused, rubbing his hands together as if trying to shake off the chill of a memory. “I woke up to Henry standing at the foot of my bed. Scared the hell out of me, too. I didn’t even hear him come in—just opened my eyes, and there he was, soaking wet from the rain.”\\n\\n“How did he even get in?” Greg asked.\\n\\n“That’s what I asked him,” Uncle Dale said. “But he wouldn’t answer. Just kept saying I had to get up, had to leave town right now. I thought he was pulling some prank or something, but then I saw his face. He was serious—more serious than I’d ever seen him.\\n\\n\"I told him my parents were out at their dance class and would be back soon. That’s when he grabbed my arm and said something I’ll never forget. He said, ‘They’re not at dance class, Dale. It’s all a lie.“\\n\\nMe and the others exchanged uneasy looks. Dance class. That’s what our parents had told us, too.\\n\\n“I didn’t know what the hell he was talking about,” Uncle Dale continued, “but he looked terrified. I told him he was scaring me, and he said, ‘You should be scared. If you don’t leave town tonight, you’re going to die like everyone else.’”\\n\\nThe room fell silent except for the crackle of the lantern.\\n\\n“I didn’t know what to believe,” Uncle Dale said. “But I could see in his eyes that he wasn’t joking. So I went with him. We got into his car and drove out into the rain. I noticed Henry had packed it up—blankets, food, clothes. It wasn’t just some wild idea. He’d been planning this. Henry wouldn’t let me drive through town. He kept us on back roads, barely lit, barely traveled. And then, about halfway out of town, I saw it.”\\n\\nI tensed.\\n\\n“It looked human, at first,” Uncle Dale said. “But as the headlights hit it, I could see the way it moved. The skin—dark, oily. Its limbs were too long, its joints all wrong. I hit the brakes so hard we almost skidded off the road.”\\n\\n“A lurker,” Tommy whispered.\\n\\n“Yeah,” Uncle Dale nodded grimly. “But here’s the thing—it didn’t attack us. I was panicking, telling Henry we needed to turn around, but he just got out of the car. I yelled at him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen. He walked right up to it.”\\n\\n“What happened?” I asked.\\n\\nUncle Dale’s voice dropped. “It looked at him. And then it backed off. Just slinked away into the trees like some trained dog. That’s when Henry turned to me and said, ‘They won’t touch me.”\\n\\nI shivered at the thought.\\n\\n“He started talking after that,” Uncle Dale continued. “Told me everything. About his family. How they weren’t normal—how they’d never been normal. He said it all went back to his grandmother, Lydia. She wasn’t just some cranky old woman. She was the one who started it all.”\\n\\n“Started what?” Greg asked.\\n\\n“The cult,” Uncle Dale said. “She was the one who brought everyone together. She convinced them it was for protection, for prosperity. But it wasn’t just prayers they were offering. Every 18 years, they’d leave their kids behind while they went to their so-called ‘dance class.’ Only it wasn’t a dance class—it was a cult.”\\n\\nThe group froze.\\n\\n“Henry had only learned about it recently at that time.“ Uncle Dale explained. “He’d overheard something he wasn’t supposed to and when he confronted his parents, they didn’t deny it. They just tried to convince him to go along with it, to ‘carry on the family legacy.”\\n\\n“But he refused,” Uncle Dale continued. “And he tried to save me. Told me to take the car and leave town. I begged him to come with me, but he wouldn’t. He said he had to stay behind—to find out what was really going on and stop it if he could. That\\'s when we parted ways.”\\n\\nThe room was so quiet that the ticking of Uncle Dale’s watch sounded like thunder.\\n\\n“But that’s obviously not where it ends,” he said finally.\\n\\n“It was years later—after the army, after everything I saw over there—I just wanted to settle down. A normal life. I met Beth, married her, and figured we’d find somewhere quiet to start over. Clearbrook... it popped into my head. And I don’t know why I even thought of it. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe guilt. Hell, maybe I just needed answers.”\\n\\nTommy shifted in his seat, and Uncle Dale caught it.\\n\\n“I know what you’re thinking. Why come back here, right? I ask myself that every damn day.” He sighed. “But I did. Beth and I moved here, and I didn’t tell her—didn’t tell anyone—about what happened that night. I thought... I thought it was done.”\\n\\nHis voice cracked, just barely, but he swallowed it down.\\n\\n“The town looked good. Better than I remembered. And when I found out Henry was mayor? I felt relieved. Thought maybe he’d really fixed things, you know? So I went to see him.”\\n\\nUncle Dale leaned back, shaking his head with a bitter smile.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you this much—seeing him again after all those years? It felt... right. We hugged, laughed, caught up on life like nothing ever happened. But it did happen, and I couldn’t let it go. So I asked him. Point blank.\\n\\n“What the hell happened that night?”\\n\\n“Henry told me everything—or at least, I thought he did. Said after I left, it got bad. Real bad. Friends died. Some of the town too. He told me his grandmother—Lydia—was into some dark stuff. Occultism, rituals, curses—the whole nine yards. Said she cursed the family, cursed the town. And he broke it. Or so he said.”\\n\\nTommy flinched,\\n\\n“I believed him,” Dale said, voice sharper now. “I wanted to believe him. I was so damn relieved to hear it was over. He even took me out to the graveyard—showed me our parents’ graves, told me how they died cleaning up the mess. Said some of the townsfolk were still believers, but they ‘handled it.’ Made it sound like a clean break.”\\n\\nGreg shifted uncomfortably. “And you bought that?”\\n\\n“I had to,” Uncle Dale snapped. Then his voice softened. “I had to. You don’t know what it’s like living such a life, leaving everyone behind at a young age. I needed it to be over.”\\n\\nThe room went quiet again.\\n\\n“But it wasn’t.”\\n\\nHe looked at me, then Tommy.\\n\\n“One night, Beth hands me this letter. Says Henry sent it. Inviting us to a ‘dance class.’”\\n\\nTommy’s face went pale, and we all exchanged worried glances.\\n\\n“Beth knew something was wrong—could see it all over me—but I didn’t tell her. I just said I had to talk to Henry and that I’d explain when I got back.”\\n\\nHe paused, staring at the floor like it might open up and swallow him.\\n\\n“I found Henry. Confronted him. Threw the damn letter at him and demanded answers. And that’s when I saw it. He wasn’t the same Henry I grew up with. His face… the way he smiled. Cold. Like he was looking through me.”\\n\\nUncle Dale clenched his fists.\\n\\n“He told me the truth—or at least the part he wanted me to know. He never broke the curse. Because to him, it wasn’t a curse—it was power. Control. He said those creatures—the lurkers, the darklings as he called them—they weren’t just monsters. The people in this town are divided in three factions. Immune, Lurker, and Survivor.\"\\n\\n“Immune?” Greg asked\\n\\n\"Every 18 years, those who have been infected turn into Lurkers he said. The people who are either Immune or lucky enough to survive the last time, gather around in the church.  The children of each parent are left behind. Those who survive or are even immune can come to church next time. Those who are infected stay in the city and as soon as it gets dark they transform. Their job is to infect and hunt. So there is a possibility that one of these creatures you encountered was even one of your parents...\"\\n\\n\"No way!\" Kev shouted.\\n\\nUncle Dale just kept going, his voice shaking now.\\n\\n“He also told me his grandmother—Lydia—was still alive. Barely aging. Said she’s the source of it all. Like a broodmother. Keeping the cycle going. And he wasn’t stopping with this town. He wanted more. More darklings. More control. He had everyone in his pocket—the law, the council, even the damn church.”\\n\\nTommy\\'s voice broke through. “And he just told you all of this?”\\n\\nUncle Dale nodded. “Said I’d be his right hand. Help him. Said we could be kings.”\\n\\n“What did you say?” Tommy asked.\\n\\n“I said no,” Uncle Dale snapped. “Told him to stop it before it went too far. But he just laughed and said it was already too late.”\\n\\nHe paused, his voice barely above a whisper.\\n\\n“So I ran. Ran home.”\\n\\nThe room fell deathly silent.\\n\\n“When i got home i found Beth shot.. dead on the floor. I... I couldn’t save her. Since i refused his offer... he took her from me.”\\n\\nDale’s voice cracked, and he had to take a moment.\\n\\n“I knew I couldn’t fight Henry alone. Not with those things. Not with Lydia still out there, keeping the curse alive. So I packed up, sold everything I had, and moved out to the farm. Off the grid.“\\n\\n“Why didn’t you just leave?” He looked up at Uncle Dale, his face hard but his voice trembling. “If you knew all of this—about the town, about Henry—why didn’t you just pack up and get the hell out of here?”\\n\\nUncle Dale hesitated. For the first time since he started talking, he looked ervous. Like he didn’t want to say what came next.\\n\\n“Why i never left?,” he finally said, looking Tommy in the eye, \"Well i wanted to leave, but i just couldn\\'t. He took my Beth from me. There was no way i was going to leave without taking my revenge!”\\n\\nUncle Dale paused for a moment before he spoke up again.\\n\\n\"And i couldn\\'t leave because of you Tommy.\"\\n\\nTommy blinked, confused. “What are you talking about?”\\n\\nUncle Dale swallowed hard. “Tommy... I’m not your real uncle.”\\n\\nThe room went dead quiet.\\n\\nTommy froze, like the words hit him before he could even process them. “What?”\\n\\n“I’m not your uncle,” Uncle Dale repeated, softer this time. “Not by blood.”\\n\\nTommy stood up so fast his chair nearly fell over. “What the hell does that mean?!”\\n\\nUncle Dale sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “It means... you were left with me, Tommy. Someone brought you to me—your real mom.”\\n\\nTommy took a shaky step back. “My—what? No, no, you can’t just—what are you even saying right now?”\\n\\nUncle Dale’s voice softened, but the words still felt like bricks. “A year after the night I lost Beth, a young woman showed up at my door. She had you in her arms—just a baby—and she begged me to take you in.”\\n\\nTommy’s knees felt weak. me and the others stared in stunned silence, but no one knew what to say.\\n\\n“She knew what this town was, what it could do to you, and she wanted to protect you. She couldn’t keep you safe herself—not with everything going on—so she left you with me. She sent money, visited as much as she could... but when you got older, she stopped coming around. She was ashamed, Tommy. She couldn’t face you.”\\n\\nTommy’s voice cracked. “Who is she?”\\n\\nUncle Dale froze again, but there was no point in holding back now.\\n\\n“Heather Cain. Henry’s sister“\\n\\nTommy’s eyes widened. “No...”\\n\\n“She’s your mother, Tommy.”\\n\\n“No!” Tommy shouted, backing away. “No, that’s—no, that’s not possible! What about my father then?”\\n\\n\"After he found out she was pregnant, he just left. He couldn\\'t take the burden of raising a child in a town like this”\\n\\nTommy shook his head, pacing like he could walk away from the truth. “No... this can’t—this doesn’t make any sense!”\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” Uncle Dale said, his voice raw. “I didn’t want to lie to you. But I had to keep you safe. I stayed here because of you. I couldn’t leave you behind—not with her still in this town.”\\n\\nTommy stopped pacing and turned to face him.\\n\\nUncle Dale nodded. “She is againts them... and she was trying to protect you. She loves you and she is very sorry about everything.”\\n\\nThe room was dead silent after Uncle Dale’s revelation. No one knew what to say—especially Tommy, who had stormed off without another word.\\n\\nUncle Dale stood up, already moving to follow him. “Tommy—wait! Just—just let me explain more—”\\n\\nBefore he could get any farther, Kev grabbed his shoulder, holding him back.\\n\\n“Dale, don’t,” Kev said quietly. “Just... give him some time.”\\n\\n“He needs space,” I added. “Let him process this.”\\n\\nUncle Dale’s shoulders slumped, his eyes darting toward the hallway where Tommy disappeared. “I just—I didn’t mean to hurt him. I thought I was protecting him. I—”\\n\\n“We get it,” Greg interrupted gently. “But you can’t fix it right now. Let him breathe.”\\n\\nReluctantly, Uncle Dale sank back into his chair. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, and ran a hand down his face. No one spoke for a while. The only sound was the faint hum of the old house settling and the distant rumble of thunder outside.\\n\\nUncle Dale rubbed his hands together like he was trying to wipe something dirty off them. “There’s something I didn’t tell you earlier. About the Lurkers.”\\n\\n“Of course there is,” Greg muttered under his breath.\\n\\nUncle Dale shot him a look but kept talking. “The infection doesn’t take hold all at once. At first, they’re... halfway there. Still human—but not really. Their bodies start to change. Yellow eyes. Teeth and claws. They’re weaker at first, but don’t let that fool you. That’s when they’re at their most dangerous—because they know what they’re doing.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” Ashley asked.\\n\\n“I mean they’re still smart,” Uncle Dale said. “Smart enough to trick you. Trap you. And the worst part?” He paused, letting the weight of it sink in. “Some can still talk.”\\n\\nA chill ran through the room.\\n\\n“They’re already turning, but they sound just like anyone else,” Uncle Dale said. “That’s how they get close enough to spit that black sludge and infect you.”\\n\\n“Geez,” Kev muttered.\\n\\n“But then,” Uncle Dale continued, “they evolve. The infection takes over completely. They stop looking human—they bulk up, get faster, stronger—and that’s when they stop infecting and just hunt. Because by then, anyone who’s still alive isn’t worth the trouble of infecting. They’re just prey.”\\n\\nI clenched my fists. “Does that mean that one of the infected was on the third floor hiding, while everyone was partying?.”\\n\\nUncle Dale nodded. “Most likely. But you can bet there are more out there that aren’t in the early stage anymore.”\\n\\nThe group fell silent again, the weight of it all hitting us like a sledgehammer.\\n\\nAfter a moment, I stood up and motioned to Kev and Greg.\\n\\n“Come on,” I said. “Let’s check on Tommy.”\\n\\nUncle Dale looked up at us. “Tell him I’m sorry.”\\n\\nI nodded. “We will.”\\n\\nThe three of us headed towards Tommy’s room, leaving the others behind in the dimly lit kitchen. The creak of the floorboards followed us down the hall, and when we reached Tommy’s door, I knocked gently.\\n\\n“Tommy? It’s us.”\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\nI glanced at Kev and Greg before trying the handle. It turned.\\n\\n“Tommy?” I pushed the door open slowly.\\n\\nInside, Tommy sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His shoulders were slumped, and his eyes were red—but there were no tears left. He looked up at us, his face hard but tired.\\n\\nThe room was quiet except for the soft creak of the old floorboards as we eased our way into Tommy’s room. He was still sitting on the edge of the bed, shoulders slumped, staring blankly at the floor. His face was pale, and his knuckles were white from how tightly his hands were clasped together.\\n\\nKev took a small step closer. “Your uncle—Dale—he’s sorry, man. He didn’t mean to drop all that on you like that.”\\n\\nTommy’s head snapped up, his eyes sharp. “He’s not my uncle.”\\n\\nThe words came out bitter, almost venomous, and hung in the air like a slap to the face.\\n\\nThat’s when Greg suddenly snapped. “Are you serious right now?”\\n\\nTommy flinched, clearly not expecting Greg to lash out.\\n\\n“No, seriously,” Greg continued, stepping closer. “Not your uncle? Then who the hell has been taking care of you your whole life, huh? Who fixed your bike when you smashed it into a tree? Who gave you that pocket knife you have been carrying all these years?”\\n\\nTommy’s mouth opened to respond, but Greg wasn’t done.\\n\\n“And let’s not forget the times you screwed up—like that time you stole beer from Mr. Langston’s garage. Remember that? Most parents would’ve grounded you for weeks. But Dale? He just made you clean out his toolshed and called it even. Didn’t even yell at you. Because he cares.”\\n\\nTommy looked down again, his hands shaking slightly.\\n\\nKev stepped forward next. His tone was softer, but his words hit just as hard.\\n\\n“Greg’s right, man. My dad would’ve smacked me upside the head if I’d pulled half the crap you did. And Casey’s? Don’t even get me started.”\\n\\nI gave a small nod, confirming it.\\n\\n“But Dale? He stuck with you,” Kev said. “Every damn time. He didn’t have to. He could’ve just given you over to someone else or... I don’t know... left town like he said he was gonna. But he didn’t.”\\n\\nGreg chimed back in. “And don’t forget, dude—he raised you knowing what this place is. Knowing what could happen if people found out. He stayed—for you.\"\\n\\nTommy’s breathing hitched slightly, but he stayed silent.\\n\\nThen I crouched down in front of him so he couldn’t avoid eye contact. “Look, man... we’re all messed up right now. This night—it’s hell. And finding out about your mom? About Dale? I get it. It’s a lot.”\\n\\nTommy swallowed hard but didn’t speak.\\n\\n“But here’s the thing,” I went on. “We’ve got nobody left. Not our parents. Not our teachers. Not the police. No one. It’s just us. And yeah, Dale might not be your ‘real’ uncle—but he’s more than that, man. Dale is your father.”\\n\\nThere was a long pause. Then Tommy sniffled and rubbed his eyes quickly, but it was no use—tears were already forming.\\n\\nHe let out a shaky breath and finally whispered, “You guys are such assholes.”\\n\\nGreg smirked. “Yeah, we know.”\\n\\nKev grinned and patted his shoulder. “But we’re your assholes.”\\n\\nAnd just like that, Tommy broke. The tears came faster, and before anyone could say another word, the four of us collapsed into a group hug. Tommy clung to us, his shoulders shaking as the weight of everything finally hit him all at once.\\n\\n“We are brothers,” Kev said. “All of us.”\\n\\nWhat none of us noticed at first was the figure standing in the doorway. Uncle Dale had been there the whole time, silently watching. His eyes were glassy, and his jaw was clenched as he tried to keep it together.\\n\\nWhen Tommy finally pulled away from the hug, he looked up and saw Dale standing there.\\n\\nFor a moment, neither of us spoke. Then Tommy wiped his face, stood up, and crossed the room.\\n\\nUncle Dale opened his mouth, but Tommy didn’t let him speak. He just stepped forward and threw his arms around him.\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” Tommy whispered.\\n\\nUncle Dale froze, caught off guard, but then his arms came around Tommy, holding him tight. “I’m sorry too, kid. I’m so damn sorry.”\\n\\nThe rest of us stepped back, giving them the moment they needed. When they finally pulled apart, Uncle Dale clapped Tommy on the shoulder.\\n\\n“We’re gonna figure this out,” Dale said firmly. “Together.”\\n\\nTommy nodded. “Yeah. Together.”\\n\\nI looked at the group and took a deep breath. “Alright. Let’s hash out a plan.”\\n\\nThey all nodded, the weight of the night still heavy but now tempered by something stronger—resolve.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 19}\n",

Bombs were detonated in the air, on the ground, and underground. The fallout contaminated everything from aquifers to nearby cities. Even today, the contamination in some of these sites far exceed the contamination at Chernobyl.\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Nevada Test Site and other locations have been the subject of numerous protests over the years. These protests have been reasonably well-publicized.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat has not been publicized is a long and successful campaign of eco-terrorism perpetuated by an unknown entity that occurred between 1951 and 1962.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe culprit targeted facilities, carriers, waste storage sites, and the weapons themselves. Based on surveillance, he accomplished his goals in a matter of minutes and occasionally, in a matter of seconds.\\n\\nDespite extensive efforts, no one ever learned how the culprit managed to come into such close proximity to his targets undetected. No one ever even learned how the culprit managed to inflict such a staggering amount of damage at all, let alone in such a minuscule span of time.\\n\\nThe destruction perpetuated by the culprit was so extensive that some experts estimate it set the government’s nuclear efforts back by fifteen years. As a result, the perpetrator was convicted of treason in absentia.\\n\\nThis campaign continued for nine years, until a detonation in 1962. \\n\\nShortly after the blast, an extremely large and severely injured animal dragged itself within sight of a security detail and proceeded to attack them.\\n\\nDue to the extent of its injuries, the creature was briefly incapacitated.\\n\\nAccording to classified documentation relating to the incident, military personnel could not figure out what, exactly, they were looking at. One man guessed that it was a giant mutant coyote. Another surmised that it was a new species of cougar ravaged by the bomb. Most who saw it, however, assumed it was an undiscovered and possibly deformed species of “desert ape” suffering from thermal flash burns. \\n\\nAll described the creature as “melted” or “melting.”\\n\\nWhen one of the soldiers approached, the creature regained consciousness and proceeded to attack again.\\n\\nTwo personnel died onsite. An additional service member died of radiation sickness approximately three days later. The remaining members of the security force experienced radiation sickness but did not pass away.\\n\\nAuthorities attempted to put down the animal, but soon discovered that no matter what was done to it, it would not die.\\n\\nApproximately three hours into this campaign of inadvertent torture, the creature began to speak. Despite its clearly immense suffering and substantial rage, everyone assembled agreed that it spoke articulately, even eloquently.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, the Agency of Helping Hands was alerted.\\n\\nUpon arrival, staff took one look at the entity on its table, and immediately recognized it for what it was:\\n\\nA critically and irreparably damaged Elemental.\\n\\nAmong the most enigmatic entities known to AHH-NASCU are these so-called “Elementals”— guardians who oversee, and whose wellbeing is intrinsically tied to, geographic areas. \\n\\nElemental Number Two, known as “Eli,” was the Elemental of a vast swath of desert in the American southwest.\\n\\nAs noted above, the geographic area to which Eli belongs contains areas used extensively for nuclear testing by the United States government.\\n\\nEli suffered direct catastrophic injury from these tests.\\n\\nThe impact on Eli cannot be overstated. He is so deformed and damaged as a result of his injuries that no one at the Agency has any idea what he is supposed to look like.\\n\\nAt this time, Eli resembles a blistered, hairless animal approximately eight feet long. He is able to walk upright and on all fours. His skin is raw and weeping despite all treatment administered by the Agency. Blisters form, pop, and reform multiple times per day. One of his eye sockets is empty and constantly suppurating, while the other contains a blind white eye sunken approximately halfway into his skull. His mouth has been split all the way to his temple on the left side. Eli complains of severe pain on a frequent basis.\\n\\nTo date, the Agency is incapable of sedating Eli or otherwise managing his pain.\\n\\nHis presence of mind, alertness, and orientation are precarious At times, Eli seems to believe he is still back in the desert, only to remember the truth, at which point he panics. In the past, his panic attacks have resulted deadly consequences for personnel. \\n\\nEli has been recommended for compassionate termination due to his immense suffering. However, Elementals cannot be destroyed by any known means at this time.\\n\\nWhile the Agency briefly considered returning him to his geographic territory with the assistance of Inmate 11 (Ward 1, “The Swan King”), Eli’s injuries and suffering unfortunately preclude even the most modest quality of life. \\n\\nAdditionally, he still emits dangerous levels of radiation sufficient to further contaminate any land he ventures upon, and would almost certainly inflict deadly injuries upon any living creature he encounters.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor these reasons, he must remain in Agency custody in his specialized containment chamber until a method of termination is discovered. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Interview Subject: Eli of the Desert**\\n\\n***Classification String: Noncooperative / Indestructible / Gaian / Constant / Low / Daemon***\\n\\n**Interviewers: Rachele B. & Christophe W.**\\n\\n**Interview Date: 12/22/2024**\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nI have been in the desert for as long as it has been a desert, no more and no less.\\n\\n\\n\\nI watched the desert grow from a tiny sandy outcropping in the ancient sea into the majesty it became.\\n\\n\\n\\nI grew with it even as I helped it grow. To grow, one must eat. To be eaten, one must die. In this way, death engenders life. Death is the foundation of life, and life is the foundation of death. Nothing stays alive forever, and nothing stays dead forever.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou understood this once. When did you forget?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when did you decide to make things stay dead forever? Do you know? That is the only question I have for you:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen did you decide to keep death from living again?\\n\\n\\n\\nI have no concern for mankind. I did not hurt you, but I did not help you. I did not ever embroil myself in your conflicts. It is not in my nature or my desire to do, not then and not now. That does not mean I am not a god. I am a god, yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut not a god for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am a god for the hares and the hawks and the coyotes, the songbirds and the burrowing squirrels, the beetles and the scorpions, the spiders and the mice, the hawks and the owls, the cacti and the trees, the hardy wildflowers and the deer.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing serves them but me.\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything on this earth must serve and be served. You have no idea how well-served you are. You have gods to intercede for you, gods to reroute the paths of life and death. You once had many. Now you have few, such as my brother the earth-singer and our cousin the freak. They are poor compared to what you once had. \\n\\n\\n\\nBut that is your fault. \\n\\n\\n\\nI maintain harmony and balance because harmony and balance are what the things I serve require of me. This is why I cannot serve you:\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause your conflicts, your lives, your very selves, do not align with harmony.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing corrupts balance like you, except perhaps the things that serve you and love you. \\n\\n\\n\\nThat is why I do not love you or serve you. I never have. But I did not hate you either. I regarded you as you regard the ground you walk upon: Something that simply is. Nothing more and nothing less. No concern of mine…\\n\\n\\n\\nUntil you become part of my land.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou people like to fight. You like to make war. There have always been battles and skirmishes, murders and massacres, on my lands.\\n\\n\\n\\nI took no part.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I think that was wrong of me.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe people who lived on my land were still people. They still fought. They still upset the balance. But they strived — they did not succeed, but they strived — to maintain balance all the same. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore importantly, they revered the hares and the hawks, the coyotes and the deer, the scorpions and the spiders, the songbirds and the mice. They did not love them as I did, but they loved them as much as they could.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost importantly, they respected them all in a way the people who came after did not.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd to this day, do not.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not understand how fortunate I was to have them until they were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe invaders came and fought against my maintainers. My maintainers were murdered and left by my trees to rot. \\n\\n\\n\\nI ignored them. I always ignore your corpses.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut my land did not ignore the corpses.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe earth noticed them, and the trees remembered what I forgot: That these corpses were people who respected hares and hawks and wildflowers and coyotes. People who strived to maintain balance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trees respected them in turn. They folded the corpses into themselves, drawing them up through their roots as though they were soil and water.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is how the corpses became one with my trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that was how I came to know mankind: Because my trees decided to love you and draw you up deep into their own hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish they had not done this, because taught me to think much more of man than you actually are.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not know that then. I only knew that my trees had welcomed you into harmony. I only knew that I now served you.\\n\\n\\n\\nI communed with the corpse-trees, just as I communed with the soil-trees and the earth, the hares and the hawks and the coyotes. The corpse trees whispers songs of their ancestors and their children, their human dreams and fears, the bitterness of humanity lost and the sweetness of harmony gained, of their hopes and their loves and their contentment and their grief. They sang to me of these things under darkening skies and vast multitude of stars as nightbirds hunted and coyotes chorused to the rising moon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI tended them. I cared for them. And because I was their god — the only god they had — I came to love them, as I love everything I serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I learned to love them, they learned that I served them. Once they understood this, they prayed to me. Their prayers took the form of wind roaring through their leaves beautiful song of water bubbling through their wooden veins.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were very beautiful. Pure in ways only trees can be, passionate in ways only you can be.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe coyotes have always been my favorite, but the corpse-trees came very close.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen settlers came and cut them them down, stopping their beautiful hearts, desecrating their perfect bodies to build wagons and homesteads, I heard their prayers. I heard their screams.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I was too far away to answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the time I arrived, they were gone. I heard the dying whispers of their last angry prayers rising from the ragged stumps. They wanted vengeance. Trees do not desire vengeance.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut those trees were not only trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not a god of man, but I am a god of trees — even of trees who were once men.\\n\\n\\n\\nI answered the prayers of my corpse-trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter answering, I made sure the remains of their mutilators would never be welcomed into my trees or my wildflowers, or even into the mouths of my scavengers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was long ago. Too long ago to matter anymore to anyone but me.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I tell you this so that you understand that my corpse-trees are why I learned to tolerate human beings. \\n\\n\\n\\nI still did not intercede in your conflicts, for I am not your god.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I allowed your conflicts to play out on my lands.\\n\\n\\n\\nI made sure that those who died in your conflicts were taken up into my worshippers, through roots and teeth. As long as those who survived worked to achieve balance with the land, I let them stay. I let them grow. Growth and decay are the essence of harmony.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I let harmony run its course, and I retreated from their settlements.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was not watchful.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead, I was consumed and fulfilled in equal measure by my hares and hawks, my wild singing coyotes and wise little owls, my scorpions and my ground squirrels. I was so intent on serving them that I forgot to protect them.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not notice as you changed and grew and overgrew. I did not notice that you overran. \\n\\n\\n\\nI did not notice how you upset the balance until it was already destroyed.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember your first bomb.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember the screaming of my hawks and my hares, and the madness-song of my clever, beautiful coyotes.\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember all of them screaming to me for help, screaming to me to make it stop, screaming for me, their only protector, their only god, to save them.\\n\\n\\n\\nI could not save them. I could not protect them. I could not comfort them in their agony.\\n\\n\\n\\nI too was destroyed, so I could not even answer them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey died alone, believing themselves abandoned by their only protector.\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot bring myself think of this. I cannot. It is the only thought that hurts even more than what is left of my body.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow could you do that to them?\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is my only question for you;\\n\\n\\n\\nHow could you do that? \\n\\n\\n\\nI thought I was dead. I wanted to be dead, from shame and from sheer, indescribably agony. But I cannot die.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as my flesh was melting, even as my eyes were blind, even as my bones rotted and reformed inside my body, I could not die.\\n\\n\\n\\nI crawled blindly across my lands, seeking those whom I serve and weeping when I could not find them. I sensed the obliteration, felt the devastation with every part of my burnt and melting body. In my rotting marrow, I sensed the worst thing of all: The destruction of balance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cycle of life and death cut to pieces.\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything that died, all of my trees and hawks and hares and spiders and coyotes, destroyed so thoroughly that they cannot live again. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe desolation of death that can no longer cycle back into life.\\n\\n\\n\\nI crawled until I found life.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was agony. More than agony. But every second of pain was penance. Payment, however poor, for my failure to serve what I was meant to serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nFar from the blast zone, as dusk fell and stars glimmered to life, I found coyotes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were alive, but wouldn't be for long. They were dying, bleeding, melting. Blisters and burns ravaged their flesh. When they sensed me, they yipped and chorused to me and to the moon. Even in their last moments, they sang.\\n\\n\\n\\nI gathered them all to me. It was a struggle, for I was in unimaginable pain and so were they. It made me weep to hurt them. It made me scream when their singed fur and burnt flesh sloughed off in my hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey still sang to me, even through their pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nI held them as they died. I made sure that they, at least, knew I had not abandoned them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought that the first bomb was the end.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it was only the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did everything I could to stop them. To stop you. What else could I do? What is the point of a god who cannot protect his worshippers?\\n\\n\\n\\nI could not protect them anymore, but I could pay penance and I could serve them by destroyed your bombs, your supplies, your equipment. I could serve them by undoing your work.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing I did was enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing I will ever do will ever be enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot describe my pain to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot the pain in my body, the agony that explodes each and every second in each and every one of my cells like the bombs with which you killed my land.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot the horror that came on the day I realized the pain did not lessen. That it will never lessen. That for as long as the desert exists, even dead, the pain will only grow.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot the pain of my worshippers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot the pain of my failure, which is the worst of all.\\n\\n\\n\\nPain incites madness. I was mad. I am mad. I will always be mad now.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I would not spare myself this pain, even if I could, even if you could, because I deserve it.\\n\\n\\n\\nPain is not only the consequence of my failure. It is my how I remember hares and the hawks and the coyotes, the songbirds and the burrowing squirrels, the beetles and the scorpions, the spiders and the mice, the hawks and the owls, the cacti and the trees, the hardy wildflowers and the deer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPain is the only sacrifice I can give to those I failed to save.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I could, I would inflict this pain on you as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou deserve this pain because you have forgotten harmony. Perhaps you never understood it at all. You do not value what you do not understand. Looking at you, I see there is much you do not understand.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat you do understand - what you have always understood - is destruction. You destroyed everything that was mine, not even from a desire to destroy me.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly from a desire to destroy each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of each other, you destroyed the hares, so fleet and strong. You destroyed the eagles, soaring above all. You destroyed the owls and the mice, the songbirds and the trees and the petrified seabeds. You destroyed the scorpions, hunting in the night. You destroyed my coyotes in their packs, singing to the moon and stars.  \\n\\n\\n\\nYou destroyed me.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou did not even want to destroy me. That is what I do not understand. You did not think of me or my hares or my birds or scorpions or my coyotes with their sweet primal song. You only wanted to destroy each other. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhy then did you not simply continue to destroy yourselves?\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is my only question for you:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did you not destroy each other, and leave everything else to live?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don’t even stop with each other. You go so far as to destroy what serves you.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you understand?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou destroy what you need without understanding that what you need does not need you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\* \\\\* \\\\*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is kind of a twofer, but in a supremely unsatisfying way.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as we got done with Eli — like the second we were done decontaminating, while I still had images of coyotes and moons dancing through my heart, while I was still crying for God’s sake — the commander ordered Christophe and I to go talk to the Harlequin yet again. \\n\\n\\n\\n“What am I supposed to talk to him about?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ask him about Ms. Pauley.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe led us to a secure interview room. Sure enough, the Harlequin was looming across the table, staring blankly at the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some reason he was in shackles, which — if you know anything about the Harlequin — is useless to the point of absurdity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we walked in, he shuddered. “Just so you know, this is not how I wanted to spend my afternoon.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And? You think this is how we want to spend ours?” Christophe flopped down into a chair across from him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Harlequin frowned distastefully. “Why are *you* even here?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“Because she is not allowed to do interviews without someone she is afraid of, and I am the only one she is afraid of.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThat frown transformed into an extraordinarily wide smile. “Really?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why is *she* afraid of *you*?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ask her.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe immediately rounded on me, wide-eyed and bright and looking like he was on the verge of mania. “Don’t worry. I respect your privacy, so we’ll talk later,” he said in a stage whisper, “where he can’t eavesdrop.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis voice returned to a much higher volume than was necessary. “Now, what are we talking about today, sweetheart?” He wiped a tear away, smiling. “I’m sorry. I’m just so proud of you. It’s so exciting to see you working. So very proud. Anyway, I’m sorry. I’m interfering with your work now. Let’s get started.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Interview Subject: The Harlequin**\\n\\n***Classification String: Uncooperative / Indestructible / Olympic / Protean/ Critical / Egregore***\\n\\n**Interviewers: Rachele B. & Christophe W.**\\n\\n**Interview Date: 12/22/2024**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have no dealings with Ms. Pauley at this time.\\n\\n\\n\\nNone whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t misunderstand me. She is a very fascinating woman, but she’s also…how do I put this?\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, yes:\\n\\n\\n\\nDistinctly unentertaining.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides, she is, shall we say, taken. I wouldn’t dream of taking a belonging from its owner. That’s stealing. I’m no thief. Unlike you.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have no doubt that she’s up to something. Who isn’t? But whatever she’s up to right now has nothing to do with me. Not because I wouldn’t enjoy getting up to things with her — I know myself too well to say otherwise — just because she’s under lock and key. Locks and keys aren’t especially difficult for me to handle, but there does come a point when effort — however minimal — simply isn’t worth the result.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this time, Ms. Pauley is not worth the effort.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know who *is* worth my effort?\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s see if you can drag it out of me. Dragons can drag, can’t they? Can’t they?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Lioness. Yes!\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, your hyena is actually worth the most effort of all. He’s the one you call a ghoul, and the only other inmate that you stole from another continent. It’s nice to have such a commonality with another inmate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that hyena is so useful in ways you can’t begin to understand. Even better, he’s made of absolutely everything I love…but he’s a project I don’t have patience for just yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t like that you dragged that out of me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t like that at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nCome here.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Come here.*\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. I will not let go of you until I am done.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Hold still.*\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nTell your company man to sit like the good dog he isn’t, or I will turn you into something neither of you can imagine right before I tear him in half and turn each of his halves into something even I can’t imagine.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShall I count to three, Mr. Wolf? One, two—\\n\\n\\n\\nGood boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, since you’ve made me talk, it’s only polite to let me finish talking. There are four things you need to understand:\\n\\n\\n\\nYour agent classification is by courtesy only.\\n\\n\\n\\nI live in your pantheon by courtesy only.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour pantheon stands by my courtesy only. \\n\\n\\n\\nI am not feeling particularly courteous anymore.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny other questions?\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I’ll let go, just like you asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere.\\n\\n\\n\\nSee?\\n\\n\\n\\nOh. Oh, no — I left bruises. I’m sorry. Believe me, it was entirely unintentional. I don’t know my own strength, especially when someone upsets me. I ask that you take care to remember that in future.\\n\\n\\n\\nI also ask you to remember that nothing upsets me quite as much as when my children refuse to get along.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore you go, I would like to apologize for losing my temper. Also, I feel it’s necessary to clarify that I would only turn Mr. Wolf into something neither of you can imagine. I would never do such a thing to my own daughter, however angry she makes me. Him, though? Well, let’s put it this way:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere I’m from, it’s always open season on wolves.\\n\\n\\n\\nGet out of my cell.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd tell them to bring me a TV.

The sound was raspy and labored, yet wet, as though He was breathing through a punctured lung. There was a distinct gurgling noise that reminded me of my infant niece. I remember the last time I held her. She looked up at me with her bright, curious eyes and made a happy giggling sound that sounded like several bubbles popping in her throat. It’s fuzzy after that, most likely due to the concussion.\\n\\nThrough the crack in my curtains, the dull glow of the moon reflected off His eyes, forcing them to look as if they were giving off their own light source.\\xa0\\n\\nI squeezed my eyes shut in the hopes that He would go away, that I might wake up to the brighter light of the morning sun gliding across my bed. Another body warm and real next to mine.\\xa0\\n\\nNo such thing happened. There was a sound, barely audible but easily identifiable. The shuffling of fabric, and the soft creak of a floor board. They broke through the silence of the night paired with the sounds of my own frenzied panting, each sound layered on top of each other in a haunting triad.\\xa0\\n\\nMeeting His eyes, I saw that they were bigger. Closer. I was delirious with sleep and fear, uncertain if what I saw was truly there, so, just to be sure, I closed my eyes once more in a move of irrational stupidity. More shuffling.

      "{'post_id': '1hkb4rd', 'post_time': 1734911644.0, 'title': 'Do you want to know the truth?', 'author': Redditor(name='bluenevereveryellow'), 'subreddit_name': 'nosleep', 'content': \"Do you want to know the truth?\\n\\nMy boyfriend, Seth, has - or had, I should say - been in my life since I was 14 years old. I remember it very vividly because the same night that he and his family moved into town, my step father… Well, he did something awful to me, and that was the start of 2 years of even worse hell than my previous 14 years had been.\\n\\nThat awful night, after my step father left the room, I gazed out of my bedroom window, tears rolling down my cheeks. I was frightened and alone. That’s when I saw Seth for the first time. He must have just moved into the large house opposite; the posh, detached, three storey house. He was in the bedroom that was directly across from mine. His dad was in there with him, his arm thrown around his shoulders, pointing around at the bare walls, probably chatting about how to make it their own. I watched his mum enter the room with a tray of mugs. ‘Probably hot chocolate’, I remember thinking, my mouth watering and my stomach grumbling.\\n\\nSeth was there in the middle of his family, the centre of their universe, and I was mesmerised by him. He had messy black hair and a mischievous grin, and I could see his parents laughing so I just knew he was funny. They were an attractive family, the sort you see in stock photos but without the dead eyes. Their eyes were full of love.\\n\\nI desperately wanted to be friends with someone like him, but I didn’t believe he would ever want to be friends with the weird kid of the neighbourhood. There wasn’t \\\\*anyone\\\\* who wanted to be friends with me. \\n\\nSeth wasn’t just anyone, though. He was very special. On that first proper day of him living there, my mum had tossed me out onto the street to play with the kids who lived on the road, even though she knew they just picked on me. Seth’s mum probably encouraged him to get out and make some new friends while her and his dad unpacked their things. As Chelsea, a girl in my year at school who lived on my street, and her younger cousin, who stayed with them regularly, were being horrible to me, I saw him doing kickflips on a skateboard in his front garden.\\n\\n“Rose, why don’t you ever brush your hair? You look so ugly” Chelsea sneered at me, her cousin cackling like a hyena. They were right, I \\\\*did\\\\* look ugly, and I really did never brush my hair. I think that’s what stung the most. You get horrible people in life who do and say awful things to you, but you can take comfort in the fact that that person is just a terrible excuse for a human being. But when you’re attacked with a truth, it cuts through you like a knife. The truth can either completely devastate us or it can give us the strength to rise up. I seemed to be constantly devastated by it. \\n\\nAfter throwing a few more painful insults about my personal appearance, they got bored and wandered off. Probably into town to hang around with their mass of friends. Why do the mean kids always have so many friends? As soon as they had gone, Seth wandered over to me. \\n\\n“Hi. I'm Seth.” He said, his voice shy but with a confidence I knew I would never have. \\n\\n“Hello,” I responded, nervously. I couldn’t understand why he was talking to me, and when he sat down on the curb next to me I flinched, expecting him to do something nasty. Instead, he kicked at a stone lazily at his feet.\\n\\n“Those girls seem pretty... awful.” He mumbled. I was shocked. I had expected him to ask me to introduce him to Chelsea, because all the lads my age wanted to go out with her. But I could tell from the tone of his voice that he was disgusted by the way they spoke to me, and my heart soared. \\n\\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw my mum coming out of the front door. I stood up quickly while she locked up, and headed around the corner where I knew she wouldn’t see me. I didn’t want her yelling at me or telling me to do something. \\n\\nTo my surprise, Seth followed me. We stood next to each other silently, both aware I was hiding from my mother. He didn’t make fun of the way I stooped when I walked, like so many of the other kids did. Like a tortoise trying to hide in its shell, which earned me the nickname tortoise at school. The truth stung.\\n\\nAfter 30 seconds, I allowed myself to breath. I looked up and he was staring at me, smiling kindly. I darted my eyes to the ground, unable to keep eye contact. He lightly touched my chin, raising my eyes to meet his.\\n\\n“Do you want to watch The X-Files with me?” He asked me, gently. \\n\\n“O...Ok.” I stuttered, sure it was all a trick. I swallowed noisily, trying to gulp down my insecurities. “Aren’t your parents still unpacking, though?”\\n\\n“Yeh, well, we can watch it at yours, right? My parents work from home, so I’m not really allowed friends over.”\\n\\nI nodded, smiling now, aware that I looked goofy but unable to hide my grin. Friends! So I led him to my house and showed him how to climb up to the fixture above my front door, and then pull up into my bedroom window. I always left it slightly open because my mum and stepdad often locked me out when they were out for hours on end. \\n\\nI was nervous, at first, having a boy in my room for the very first time. There was mould all up the walls and I had no sheets on my quilt. My pillows had all funny yellow stains on, and there were holes in my mattress where I had been playing with one of my mum’s lighters when I was bored. Seth didn’t seem to notice, though. Or at least he pretended not to. Either way, he seemed so at ease that it kept me from feeling humiliated.\\n\\nWe sat on my bed next to each other, and that became our daily routine over the summer. As soon as my mum went out, we would jump up and watch The X-Files. Over and over again.\\n\\nI couldn’t believe it when, a few weeks in, Seth put his arm around me as we were watching. My stomach did a flip as I nestled into him I felt, hearing his heart pound in his chest. For the first time in my life, I felt accepted. \\n\\nWe fell in love, even though we were so young. I kept him a secret from my parents, because they were truly evil and I didn’t want Seth to have to have such negative monsters in his life. But his parents knew all about us, and his mum and dad often chatted to me in the street.\\n\\nIt didn’t matter to him that I had no friends… In fact, it seemed to suit him. He was a huge introvert - probably on the spectrum - and I preferred to keep him all to myself, anyway. He was unbelievably gorgeous, his hair always perfect, his clothes always new and so stylish. But he kept himself to himself, so I didn’t have to contend with all the girls of the neighbourhood trying to tempt him from me.\\n\\nI asked him, one day, what he saw in me. \\n\\n“You’re beautiful. You’re clever. You’re funny.” He said. I grinned at him like the Cheshire Cat, knowing none of that was true but also believing that he saw me that way. \\n\\nIt was the best summer I’d ever had, even though the worst things my step father did to me began that year. However, Seth had been the most perfect distraction. Chelsea even moved away, so I didn’t have to deal with her and her vile cousin anymore. I heard my parents talking about it one evening. They’d heard she had taken an overdose and barely survived… she had some sort of brain damage. Her family moved swiftly away for ‘a fresh start’. I was pleased that I wouldn’t have to have her treating me so terribly anymore, but sad that she had had so much bitterness and anger inside her that she’d felt she needed to try and end it.\\n\\nWhen school started back in September, I found that Seth was home educated. He had a habit of not really telling me huge things about himself unless they were completely relevant, he was more of a listener than a talker. I was glad that he wouldn’t have to see me getting bullied every day. Even though home life had become so much more bearable now I had Seth, I knew the school days would be as miserable as before.\\n\\nSometimes I wished he was there to stand up for me, but every evening as soon as my mum had fallen asleep and my stepdad had left my room, Seth would climb up and into my room and make me feel better. We’d cuddle, watch The X-Files and sometimes kiss. But even as the years went by, he never, ever pushed me any further. I never told him what my stepfather did, but I think he knew, and he was content with what we had. He just wanted to make me happy.\\n\\nWhen I was 16, my step father died. He slit his wrists in the bathtub. I was out in the woods with Seth at the time, and my mum was working. I felt irrationally guilty about it all afterwards. Maybe if I’d been home I could have stopped him. Maybe I could have got him some help.\\n\\n“But why would you want to?” Seth had asked. I wasn’t sure, so I didn’t answer.\\n\\nLosing my step dad had pushed my already bitter mother over the edge and she was furious, all the time. She drank more and more, and she took it all out on me. After a year I could no longer cope with it, and so I left home.\\n\\nI was placed in a council flat in a very rough area of town, but even though the neighbours screamed and fought and took drugs in the stairways, at least I was away from home. I saw a light shining somewhere in my future. Seth would come over most nights, and sometimes he would stay with me. Other times he would go home after I had fallen asleep. He was always there when I needed him, and every day I felt myself becoming stronger.\\n\\nHe worked for his parent’s tech business, mainly remotely. It suited his need for solitude. I worked in a dead end factory job which was soul destroying, honestly. I thought I would lose my mind at points. But I had to pay the bills and buy food. I couldn’t escape my depression, and before long Seth moved in full time to try and keep me in bright spirits. His parents didn’t pay him well, wanting to teach him some sort of life lesson about privilege, so we always struggled for money but we had each other, and we were happy.\\n\\nYou never really heal from an abusive childhood, but things get easier over the years. And with Seth by my side, things really did improve. When I was in my early 20s, I went to college and got the qualifications I needed to attend university. I struggled at college. I still never fitted in anywhere, and had very low self confidence. But when I started uni, there were so many people there that I was barely noticed.\\n\\nEarly on in my first year, Seth had to work in London for a month. I wanted to surprise him when he got back. I threw out my wardrobe of baggy, black clothes that had always rendered me as close to invisible as possible, and bought some tight fitting, bright dresses. I got my haircut and I allowed myself to stand out. When he got back, he held me for a long time. \\n\\n“I’ve missed you.” He said. “You look beautiful. You know you always do, though, don’t you?” I blushed, turning on The X-Files and cuddling into him all evening.\\n\\nI was nervous about my new style getting noticed at uni. I know that seems weird, but the idea of people complimenting the change would make me face the fact that there had been a problem in the first place. However, there were so many people there that they really didn’t notice. Not directly, anyway. I did find that people made more of an effort to talk to me. I began to make friends.\\n\\nI was encouraged by my peers to join societies based on my interests. One night at a social event, I met some bloke who was studying art who quite clearly wanted to be more than friends. I couldn’t believe it! I told him I had a boyfriend, but would love to be friends. He seemed disappointed that we wouldn’t go any further. I was so flattered! When I got the bus home that night, I couldn’t stop smiling.\\n\\nI told Seth about it and he laughed. “Of course he tried it on. You’re perfect.”\\n\\nI graduated, not inviting my mum, who I was estranged from now. Seth was working away more frequently now, and the graduation ceremony coincided with him being in London. When he offered to tell his parents he needed to come home, I promised him that it was fine. I didn’t mind. I insisted he stayed there. I was kind of glad to simply share it with my university friends. It seemed like I had created my own safe spot there, just for me. Plus, I had an inkling that his parents were setting him up to take over company when they retired. I believed that good times were coming for both of us.\\n\\nAs yet more years passed, I climbed up the ladder in my new job that I had practically walked into, with my degree and my new found confidence. Seth and I did little more than best friends might, but we adored each other with a passion that my proper friends were envious of when I told them about it. He was the perfect boyfriend. \\n\\nHowever, when a new boss took over my section at work, depression started to cripple me in bouts. He was a misogynistic bully and he reminded me of my step dad. Every day I was terrified of being called into his office. When he walked past me, I struggled to breathe. \\n\\nI found myself coping by retreating into my imagination. During those dark times that often lasted weeks, sometimes even months, I have to admit that I pushed Seth away. I would become obsessed with celebrities that I had watched on the television, forming wild crushes on them and creating entire personalities for them, with story lines that centred around them falling in love with me. I would imagine they were there with me, holding me to sleep, falling in love with me, doing everyday things with me… all the things that my wonderful Seth had done for so many years. He was left behind, but I was honest with him. I told him about my imaginary affairs, and what was happening at work. He told me they were a coping mechanism and though they probably weren’t healthy, they were a sign of a shift in my mental state. He promised that I shouldn’t feel guilty about them. After all, it wasn’t real.\\n\\nAs my boss started to call me into his office more regularly, openly staring at my breasts and legs, my mental health deteriorated. I retreated further and further into my imaginary relationships, sometimes calling in sick just so I could spend time with my creations. I didn’t really see it as dangerous. Well, not until I went to see a comedian perform at the theatre and I booked \\\\*two\\\\* tickets even though I attended alone. I wanted to pretend one of my creations was there with me. I kept turning and laughing at the empty space, pretending he was next to me, falling in love with me a little bit more every time I laughed because I was giving him an insight into the way my mind worked.\\n\\nAs I made my way home, I felt sick with shame. I was allowing my weird game to spill over into my real life. I knew what I had just done was dangerous. I also felt rueful that I felt sexually attracted to these creations, but I had never even been able to sleep with Seth. \\n\\nI fell into bed and sobbed hysterically when I got home. I felt Seth’s arm rubbing my back. \\n\\n“Rose, what’s wrong?” He asked. But I couldn't speak, I just shook my head frantically. “Please. You can tell me anything.” He urged me. “You know that. I just want to help you.”\\n\\nI swallowed down the sobs and told him what I had done. I told him how out of hand this was getting. I told him I was scared that I was crazy.\\n\\n“Perhaps you realising that it’s getting out of hand is a good thing, Rose.” He said, stroking my hair. “Maybe this is your glass shattering moment, you know? They say crazy people don’t actually know they’re crazy, they think they’re normal. So you can’t be crazy, right?”\\n\\nHe had calmed me down, and comforted me like he always did. I fell asleep with my arms wrapped around him for a while, listening to his heart beat slowly. My Seth. My saviour. \\n\\nI woke up at 3am with chest pains. Seth held me close, helping me catch my breath. “What’s wrong with me?” I gasped. \\n\\n“You’re panicking, Rose. It’s your mind making your body react this way. You’re having a bad reaction from facing the truth. It will get better soon. I promise.” \\n\\nIt was my first ever panic attack, but looking back now I guess I was lucky not to have been having them for much longer. And though I trusted Seth, it didn’t feel like it was *ever* going to get better. Night after night in the following weeks, I would fall asleep listening to Seth’s heart beat. Then I would wake up hours later, my chest tight, struggling to breathe, crippled, frozen to the spot.\\n\\nA few weeks after the first, I whispered to him as I recovered. “When is this going to end?”\\n\\nHe sighed. “Whenever you want it to, Rose.”\\n\\nI went back to sleep.\\n\\nThe next night, after yet another panic attack, I lay there exhausted. I shuffled out of his arms and twisted around so I could look at him. “I don’t want to lose you.” I said, my lip trembling and a lump in my throat. “I can’t imagine a world without you in it.” Tears filled my eyes, so I looked down.\\n\\nHe smiled at me, then he lightly touched my chin, raising my eyes to meet his. My tears spilled out. “The good thing is, Rose, that you don’t have to imagine a world without me in it, do you? You just have to step into it. You just need to say goodbye.”\\n\\n“How long have you known for?” I asked him, the tears flowing freely now, because I knew this was the end. \\n\\nHe was calm. “As long as you have, I suppose. I think that’s the way it works. And there’s no point in asking me questions about the meaning of it all, because you know as much as I do already. Or, I guess I should say, \\\\*I\\\\* know as much as \\\\*you\\\\* do.” He shrugged. \\n\\n“But… What’s changed? Why now?” I pleaded.\\n\\nSeth gripped me into a bear hug. “*You* have changed. You’re getting better, can’t you see? Going to the theatre, realising what you did was unhealthy, that was just the beginning. It’s just been me and you for so long, Rose, since your step dad…” He let the sentence trail off.\\n\\n“I invented you the first night he did it to me.” I murmured. \\n\\n“Looks that way, doesn’t it?” I felt him kiss me on the head as I pushed my face into his chest, my heart breaking. \\n\\n“Hey, cheer up.” He said. “Maybe in a parallel universe, \\\\*I’m\\\\* the real one and \\\\*you’re\\\\* the imaginary friend.” I laughed, even though I felt like my insides were being ripped out.\\n\\n“Do you want to watch The X-Files with me?” He asked me, gently. I nodded, and turned on the television, crying silently all the way through, but safely cuddled into him. I fell asleep listening to his heart beating, slower than before. I supposed it had been getting slower every night, these last weeks. I just hadn’t wanted to accept it.\\n\\nWhen I woke in the morning, I was cuddling my pillow. It was still wet from my tears. I had a ball of pain in my stomach, and I believed that I would not see Seth again, so the pain I felt was grief. I had lost my best friend, my protector, the person who had always saw beauty in me when everyone else had seen a freak. But I also knew that he was my creation, so essentially he had simply been a version of me. I’d always found it cheesy when people were dying in movies and they’d say “I’ll always live on inside you.”, but in this case Seth really would live on inside me, somewhere.\\n\\nI drove to my parents old house that afternoon, and I wasn’t surprised to find there was no house across the road from mine. I always knew, I’d just buried it down. It was just an unused, three storey, shoddy council building. I stared at it for a while, looking through the window that I had pretended was Seth’s room. And for a moment I thought I saw him, staring back at me, his face contorted in terror, screaming silently, fists banging against the window. His eyes pleading with me to release him. But I closed my eyes, counted to ten, and when I reopened them there was nothing there.\\n\\nIt’s strange, really, because just a few weeks later, my boss threw himself out of the top window of that old council building, so close to my parents house, so close to my life. It’s funny how life is full of such strange little coincidences. \\n\\nI was sorry he felt so disgusted by his perverted ways that he needed to end his life. But I was glad that life at work started to go back to normal, and I began to flourish again.\\n\\nI have my first appointment with a very good therapist soon. It’s expensive, but I know it will be worth it. I won’t tell them about Seth. I always liked to keep him all to myself. But I’ll tell them about the obsessive crushes, and what my step dad did. \\n\\nUnless, of course, I’m imagining the therapist. Or the dream job I have that allows me to pay for it. Maybe I’m locked in an asylum somewhere, maybe I cracked at some point and… Well, maybe everything is in my mind, created by myself to protect me from the truth.     \", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 60}\n",

There was nothing else… not even board games,” my dad snapped back.\\n\\n“It won’t be enough… BRAD, it won’t be enough!” my mother reapeted crying out in panic.\\n\\n“It will be. We just need to…I need you to go upstairs. I think there’s a Monopoly board under John’s bed,” my dad said, tightening the front wheel with a wrench.\\n\\n“But… we can’t… you said we needed that as a last resort,” my mother said, her breath quickening. Tears of impending doom welled in her eyes.\\n\\nMy dad finished the bicycle and stood up. The fire from the fireplace crackled, casting a glow on his sweat-drenched forehead. He took out a handkerchief and dabbed his head. “Just please get the board and bring it down.”\\n\\nThe clock ticked in the dimly lit room. A Christmas tree flashed colorful lights in the corner. A mistletoe hung lazily from the ceiling, they say all this helps keep it out...it never does.\\n\\nI knew it was tonight. I’ve seen it for the past seven years… well, I remember the last seven, not my first three. The one night of the year that everyone prepares for…\\n\\n“Okay, I’ll go,” my mother sighed, tears now streaming down her face. She turned to leave the room and then, in shock, spotted me peeking in from the stairs in the hallway.\\n\\n“Tommy?! You were supposed to be in bed!” my mother said in shock.\\n\\n“Let me help, I’m old enough now,” I said with my bravest voice.\\n\\n“Shhhhh,” my mother was cross. “You’ll wake your brother!”\\n\\nThe clock in the sitting room rang, indicating 1:00 AM. One hour left…\\nMy mother turned in horror, knowing it was coming soon.\\n\\n“Please, you need to get back into bed! You know what happens if it thinks you’re awake!” my mother ordered, her voice a mix of command and plea.\\n\\nI reached into my pocket handing her a small dinosaur, a green velociraptor. Small, but big enough to make a difference.\\n\\n“Where did you get that?” my mother asked, her eyes widening as if she had just seen a million-dollar bill.\\n\\n“I stole it from the Johnsons’ house when I was with them last week,” I said sorrowfully.\\n\\nMy mother carefully raised her hand and took the 4-inch toy from me. A tear rolled down her cheek, and she smiled, her eyes red and bloodshot from a day of crying.\\n\\nShe leaned over, kissed me on the forehead, and whispered, “Thank you. Now come on, let’s get you to bed.”\\n\\nMy mom walked me up the stairs slowly, quietly, and carefully, trying not to wake my younger brother. No more creaks in the floorboards to wake anyone up. Dad was prepared. As i was ushered up the stares i took one last look at Dad who was in front of the fireplace in the sitting room, using a cloth to shine up the bicycle.\\n\\nWhen we got to our bedroom, John was sound asleep. I wish I was that young again. Not knowing was much better than knowing. I got into my bed, pulling the covers up to my neck. I lay on my side, facing the wall, unable to see what was going on behind me in our small room. They say it's best to never look...\\n\\nMom leaned over and tucked the covers around me from my toes to my shoulders. She put her hand under my pillow to fluff it out. She then kissed the back of my head and softly said, “Remember, honey, it’s easier to sleep, but if anything ever happens—”\\n\\n“Yes, I know, Mom. Don’t look at it,” I finished her sentence for her.\\n\\nI could hear her sniffling as she got on her hands and knees, searching quietly. Finding what she was looking for, she slid out the Monopoly board. Grabbing it with both hands, she stood up quietly.\\n\\n“Mom?” I whispered, staring wide-eyed at the wall.\\n\\n“Yes, honey?” my mom whispered back.\\n\\n“I love you,” I whispered.\\n\\n“I love you too. Now please go back to sleep. It’s almost time. Please go to sleep,” Mom said, her voice trembling as she held back tears.\\n\\nShe slowly closed the door, turning the key until she heard the click of the lock.\\nDownstairs, I could still hear Mom and Dad whispering back and forth.\\n\\n“We need a bigger fire,” my dad commented.\\n\\n“We need more toys!” my mother snapped back.\\n\\n“This is all they had left, and we were lucky to even get this,” my dad said angrily.\\n\\n“It won’t be enough,” my mother sounded like she was losing hope. “Look, the fire will be on, and we will lock the door.”\\n\\n“And what if it’s not enough? What if it takes them and wants more? We could end up like the Jeffersons,” Mom was panicking.\\n\\n“We won’t end up like the Jeffersons,” my dad said, annoyed.\\n\\nA sudden bang came from the roof.\\n\\n“Quickly, Brad, add more sticks to the fire. It’s already here,” Mom said, hurrying through her tears.\\n\\n“I know it is. Hurry upstairs!” I heard my mom running up the stairs as Dad left the sitting room and locked the door.\\nA rumbling noise began in the wall. Dad quickly ran up the stairs and into their bedroom. I heard the key turning, locking them inside.\\n\\nThe rumbling in the wall grew louder as it rummaged down the chimney. I still don’t understand why Dad always puts the fire on… it never works. But I guess we just hoped it would…\\n\\nThe noise from the wall stopped, but only because it was now downstairs. Underneath my room. Searching, snatching, striking. I could hear the bike being fondled with. I heard a loud crash as the Monopoly pieces fell to the floor. Just chaos…\\n\\nThe sound of the door handle downstairs being pressed down again and again… Mom was right… it wasn’t enough.\\nThe door began to bang until it gave in.\\n\\nThen silence.\\n\\nAfter a few seconds, I heard my mom sobbing in the other room. They knew…\\nThe stairs weren’t meant to creak, but because of the weight of… it… the creaking told us it was coming up the stairs.\\nAnother bang. It was trying to get into my parents’ room.\\n\\n“No, please, GO AWAY,” my mother screamed.\\n\\nTwo more bangs until the door finally gave in!\\n“No, please don’t! Brad, do something!” Mom begged\\n\\n“I’m sorry, my love, you were right… it wasn’t enough,” my dad said sadly.\\n\\nI heard a thump and what sounded like twigs snapping as my mom screamed and sobbed. And then another thump and silence…\\nI stared at my wall, knowing what was coming next.\\n\\nOur door only took one big bang to give way. My brother screamed but quickly went silent. I began counting in my head, not turning around to see what was coming for me.\\nI heard it take two steps over to me. It was directly behind me. I could feel it. I could feel its warm, sticky breath tickle my ear. \\n\\nI remained still. I knew my fate; this was it.\\nBut then my pillow began to move, lifting my head ever so slightly. It was reaching for something under my pillow. Whatever it was, I heard it put it into what sounded like a plastic bag.\\n\\nThen, one step after another, it left the room, down the stairs, into the sitting room, and back up through the wall. I turned around to see if my brother was still there, but all that remained was a pool of blood in the bed. I then went to check on Mom and Dad. One pool of blood at the door to their bedroom and another in the corner of the room.\\n\\nPolice did the rounds, and there were a few families taken this year, including mine. I am blessed to still have my grandparents, who I am now living with. Thankfully, they stockpiled toys from back in the day, so next year should be fine. But there’s one thing I still don’t understand. Why would it take my family and not me?\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 31}\n",

Cruel memories.\\n\\nThe night the Rednecks died was one of viscera, but before that it was coolness on the breeze, a warmth by the fires while John played his guitar and we had only just taken two dozen kegs of lager (personal reserves) from the Atlanta despot—the man that kept his subjects as slaves and not a person among the camp was left without budding intoxication. No matter the age, everyone was invited to be merry; if it was that children too faced the plight of a bad world, then so too should they reap the moments of plenty—or so the camp figured.\\n\\nJohn had taken a group by the fires where wagons were drawn in interlocking semicircles for cover and Jackson sat beside the picker. Jackson was a man which normally preferred quiet reflection over boisterous singing and nearly never wore the band on his throat, and yet there he was belting out the chorus at the top of his lungs, tankard in hand, red cloth blazed around his neck—it was a contagion and those drunk enough for easier embarrassment sang proudly along: \\n\\n“There is power, there is power in a band of working folk!\\n\\nWhen we stand hand in hand,\\n\\nThat’s a power, that’s the power,\\n\\nThat must rule in every land!”\\n\\nI’d taken to the outlying shadows with my back pressed against the gas-powered caleche, my own tankard in hand. I loved the warmth of that great big family, truly, but even in those days—and maybe it was that queer youthfulness which longed for individualism that made me that way then—I remained as distanced as possible when I could. I sipped the lager, it was a fine drink and my brother Billy, nearly as old as I was when I’d first taken up in the infantry, swaggered to stand beside me just as quiet for minutes and we looked at the stars and he asked me what it was like to kill a man.\\n\\n“Is it hard?” he asked.\\n\\nI nodded, “Sometimes.”\\n\\n“Killing monsters ain’t so bad. Don’t know if I could do it to a person.”\\n\\n“You could if they meant to kill you; or if they meant to do it to someone you cared about,” I promised him. In those days, spry, energized, I held no time for staring into abysses; though I still wasn’t a man fully, I pretended as one. It was about family, and it was about doing what was right—what’s right seemed to change, or I changed. The world felt stark with good and evil and even later I’d feel that sentiment well up in me, but if that’s true, I know I stand more on the latter and so I intentionally obfuscated it—this I know. If not, it might be too much to bear. I was required to lie to myself and even in knowing I lied, it was better.\\n\\nBilly tugged on the red kerchief around his throat and asked me how it looked on him.\\n\\n“Looks good,” I said.\\n\\n“Don’t think I look stupid at all?”\\n\\nI smiled over my drink, “You always look stupid.” I sipped. “The neckwear’s fine.”\\n\\n“Give me a break,” said Billy; he investigated his own cup, gave it a swish with his wrist, watching its contents swirl. “Aren’t you ever afraid you’ll die?”\\n\\n“Sometimes—nights like this—I wouldn’t mind it.”\\n\\n“Really?” my brother asked.\\n\\n“There’s always a chance of it. Every moment, I guess.”\\n\\nHe smiled. “I wish I had that confidence.”\\n\\n“You’ll get it,” I returned his smile; it was true that he would gain the fighting spirit. It came to us all with time and reminiscing on the early days, I recall the grit and the hatred—there was learning there too though. Besides, I’d seen the squalors of a stationary man. The stagnation of a place, an unmoving home.\\n\\nJohn put his guitar away and laughter erupted from the crowd from something said and Sibylle, cowboy hat cocked funny, traipsed across the camp to the open keg for a refill; the man there, tending the cylinders, was a man named Tandy (a foreigner and one unknown besides the way he smoked a skunk pipe and told wild stories). My mother leaned over while Tandy opened the spigot mouth on the keg, and she froze there, and I could see her there cut out forever against the light of the fires; I watched, and it came so suddenly that I couldn’t be sure what’d happened at all. It was so sudden that I couldn’t find my weapon and I couldn’t find even the courage to fight because in those moments it wasn’t courage I needed, it was grounds to understand.\\n\\nSibylle came apart in two pieces immediately, torn completely through and dust erupted as her legs struck the ground while her torso spun through the air like a top, a trail of liquid trailed after, caught in the blue of night so it shone as black; she couldn’t scream. Tandy was a statue. Before anyone could react, more flesh, other bodies, went up and there was all manner of limbs which filled the ground, and it is astounding how quickly a red mist forms across the ground during a massacre. Perhaps the wails of my comrades started before, perhaps others fell before Sibylle, but I could not comprehend the goings-on till I saw her drop the way she did.\\n\\nFrail human screams rose on the night; I slammed to the ground, tankard gone away and hands scrambling in the dirt; I reached up blindly and yanked Billy to my level and his expression was one of innocence, panic, tears even. Glancing around, I saw the demons bolt from the pitch-black darkness on the edges of camp, mutants taking the fore while greater creatures lurked further back, some hurled whips of gliding metal which writhed over their heads when they stretched them out for a strike—alien—and they sliced directly through soft human bodies. Not even a cry escaped me, but Billy let go with it and I slapped my cupped hand over his mouth hard to hold the screams. His voice would not have been alone anyway, not alongside that startling cacophony. Amidst the cries of people, there were the cries of horses, of our hounds.\\n\\nWe rolled across the ground, slipped beneath the raised body of the gas-powered caleche, remained quiet in the dark, peeked out between the wheels.\\n\\n“What’s happening?” Billy whispered through my fingers; I removed my hand from him and caught a glimpse of him framed in a square of firelight through the wheels—we lay there on our bellies and the left side of his face was glazed with dirt where I’d pulled him down. \\n\\n“Shh,” I told him, “Shh, please. Please.” Not another word came while I pleaded with him, pleaded with the world to make this all a nightmare.\\n\\nThrough the haze and the running silhouettes painted black, I saw what might have been Jackson; he stumbled and in the moment that it took me to gasp, his head was gone from his body, his torso slid on as he collapsed, came to rest mere feet from the motor wagon. I told myself that it wasn’t him, but it probably was.\\n\\nSome mutants lumbered through the camp like animated corpses, some leapt with wild energy or sprayed noxious fumes which lingered in the air; others still were amalgams of humanlike limbs themselves—fiends—exhausting terrible sounds, producing smells of sulfur, glistening with whatever liquids excreted from their oblong alien orifices. Demons ran amok, chanted in devil tongued languages, laughed madly at the destruction—others still, those which displayed some greater intelligence, broke into a song I could never hope or want to replicate; it seemed a unified damnation.\\n\\n“Please,” I repeated in a whimper and Billy hushed me this time and I realized we were holding hands, squeezing for dear life as figures walked the camp, speared those half-alive, elected others for twisted carnality.\\n\\nIn darkness, in fright plainly, we scuttled from the recess of our hiding place, kept quiet, held to each other, and went into the wasteland where nothing was—every shadow was a potential threat, every second could’ve been the last. We were holding hands; then we weren’t.\\n\\nOnly a glance—that’s all I afforded my brother and nothing more—what a joke of a person I am! What a coward I was. Always.\\n\\nSomething got him in the dark and instead of dying alongside those I cared about, I went on, heartbeat driving me till it was all that I heard in my ears and my muscles ached and my chest heaved and sweat covered me, chilled me in the breeze of the night—it was only once I’d accepted the dark completely, crawled into a hollowed space of rocks along a squat ridge that I watched the demolished camp; it seemed no larger than a spark, but the creatures, fiends and others continued their war cries; never before had I witnessed demons participate in such an attack.\\n\\nI watched till the sun came, till the fires became smoke, then I watched the band of hell creatures disband. The smell of sulfur remained in the air—copper too—and I stumbled back to the camp in a dreamlike daze, totally unbelieving of the things I saw. Among those dead on the ground, I could recognize none; among those piked from rear to shoulder, standing like morbid scarecrows where they’d been steadied against the ground, I could not want to recognize.\\n\\nMany of the wagons were overturned, including the gas-powered caleche and I went to it; the metal of its body was warped but I fell to the ground by it and pushed my back against the exposed undercarriage, remained frozen there while examining the bodies, the terrible strips of skin which rested places like wet sheets of paper, the piles of bones removed and smashed and piled.\\n\\nI cried so deeply that oxygen became a memory, and the shakes couldn’t be contained.\\n\\nIt was like that for so long, knees pulled up, face pushed between, and the wails came unafraid of whatever attention they might garner; there was no rationale, but I imagine if there had been, I would’ve welcomed death in that misery. It was a deep wound that not even my own cowardice would overcome for the sake of survival.\\n\\nUnaware of my surroundings, not wanting to look up from the ground between my legs, the noise which had started out as imaginary became real and I raised my head then to listen better and wipe my sore eyes; it was the sound of clip-clop horse hooves and I mildly wondered if any of the animals had been spared. I stood and pivoted around the dead camp and there it was, a man on a painted horse with golden hair; he leisurely drove the mount through the place, maneuvering around pools of blood, clumps of body parts and upon seeing me, he smiled and offered a languid wave, keeping one of his gloved hands on the reins.\\n\\nThe man wore white and swished his hair back upon arriving directly in front of me. *Ahoy,* he offered kindly, *Did you happen to see the other riders?*\\n\\nI shook my head, feeling numb.\\n\\n*Ah,* he said, *I could have sworn four other riders, at least, passed me on my way.* His gray eyes examined the carnage. *Shame.* He shook his head. *You are?*\\n\\n“H-harlan.”\\n\\nHe nodded and nearly offered an expression of genuine condolence before descending from the horse; the animal gave a gentle grunt and wandered away from its master to inspect a nearby group of the dead. The man offered his hand, and I took it in a shake. *Mephisto,* said the man. He flashed a smile again before his face grew serious. *I’ve come to you to deal.*\\n\\nI shot him a questioning look, one of bafflement.\\n\\n*I heard your calls from far off.* He nodded, removed a white handkerchief from his breast pocket and swiped it down his face. *Hot out.* He shrugged then replaced the cloth in his pocket. *This,* he motioned to the disarray of vehicles, of bodies, *I can’t fix all this—it’s too much—but there’s a person you love, I know. I could bring them back.*\\n\\n“Doctor?” In retrospect it was such a naïve question.\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n“Angel?”\\n\\nHe grinned and nodded, *Sure.*\\n\\n“Demon?”\\n\\n*Undoubtedly.* His eyes—pits of gray in that radiant face—nearly expressed solemness; he daintily shook the hair from his face and looked at his steed which sniffed a corpse. *What’s the word, Harlan? There are others calling and I must be on my way soon—I can’t dally.* There was a sharpness to the words. *Can’t dally. We must convene soon, or I’ll mosey on.*\\n\\nI snorted back the clog in my nose from the tears and wiped my eyes with my sleeves. “Okay.”\\n\\n*Deal?*\\n\\nI nodded, “Deal.”\\n\\n*Sleep tonight,* said Mephisto, *Sleep and you’ll be rewarded in the morning.*\\n\\n“You said it’s a deal.”\\n\\nHe nodded and scanned the carnage before we matched gazes and then he said, *Yes?*\\n\\n“What is it you want from me?”\\n\\n*Nothing you need now.* He called the horse, and it came, and he swept his feet quickly from the ground and settled into position atop the animal. *Sleep, Harlan. You won’t be bothered. There are worse things still over the horizon.*\\n\\nI watched him go till he disappeared and once he was gone, I couldn’t cry anymore and instead rummaged through the wagons for what I might carry; along the way I found John, face twisted but corpse intact. The body from the previous night that I’d guessed was Jackson couldn’t be determined but I found him nowhere else. I slid Sibylle’s holster from her hips, fell hard onto the ground and found that I could sob more. I took her cowboy hat, placed it on my head and held her pistol in one hand and the belt holster dangled from the other while I searched the other bodies; there were so many, but I could not find Billy.\\n\\nWaiting for darkness, I took the spot where I rested, back against the caleche’s undercarriage, watched the sky and felt the gun in my hand; it was heavy. I put it to my head, closed my eyes, and whispered affirmations to myself then I put the pistol between my splayed legs, watched it still in the dirt, and pulled the hat down over my eyes but it did little for the smell. Though the brim of the hat cut the sky out, I watched the ground and saw circling shadows form overhead and heard calls of turkey vultures; they came to pick over the bodies. I withdrew my knees to my chest there again and laid my forearm across them and bit into my arm while closing my eyes. I had thought I was a man and for a time, maybe I was, but there in that miserable pit of despair I became a child again and if I’d become more delirious, I’m sure I might’ve called out for Jackson like it was a bad dream.\\n\\nInto a fading stupor of sleep in the sun I went and when I awoke again it was dark and chilly and I was tired and hungry but too sick to eat and hardly strong enough to move; I looked at the gun and put it into its holster and left it there by the caleche. In the light of the moon and stars, I moved to gather a bolt of canvas; I unfurled the fabric and created a leaning shelter against the overturned vehicle and crawled into it. There was a hole in the canvas, and I peeked out at the stars.\\n\\nWeeping came again, but not so uproarious; I was stuck there letting go of whimpers, lying on my back, feeling the tears trace in lines from the outer corners of my eyes to collect along my earlobes. In time, I fell to sleep again on the hard ground because the mourning had taken all else from me.\\n\\nA pinpoint of sunlight broke my eyelids and I jerked awake and reached for the holster, but it was gone. So was the hat. I crawled from the leaning shelter and there he was.\\n\\nBilly stood plainly among the dried, congealed blood-soaked field and he looked on to the horizon and all shadows were long in the midday sun which hung up there in a soft blue sky. Whether it be a dream or a spell, I couldn’t care—I charged to him and spun him so he faced me and though his face was plain and expressionless, I wrapped him into a forceful hug. He placed his hands on my back and gave a gentle squeeze; when I pulled from him, my hands on his shoulders, I saw he held Sibylle’s hat in his left hand, pinched by the brim; he’d already tugged her holster belt around his hips—he could have it all. I shook while holding him then let go to wipe my face.\\n\\n“You’re alive,” I nodded.\\n\\nHe nodded without speaking then looked at the hat in his hand and placed it on his head and firmly pressed it down.\\n\\n“Billy! Hell, you’re alive!”\\n\\nThe corners of his mouth twitched upward for a moment then he nodded again. “Yeah.” His eyes curiously searched our surroundings like he meant to take each detail in forever.\\n\\nI slapped him on the shoulder and almost squealed. “Goddammit.” I wiped my eyes again and could do little to keep the excitement from exploding from me. “Oh, we should go. We should go on and get somewhere safe.”\\n\\nHe nodded toward the horizon, “’Lanta?”\\n\\n“Sure.”\\n\\nWe packed and it was a like an ethereal phantom remained among us beside the quiet dead; turkey vultures cawed to break the silence, pecked where they pleased on the bodies, and I couldn’t want to fight them. I kept sidelong eyes on Billy with the ever-present worry that he’d vanish. Perhaps he was the phantom.\\n\\nFrom the rear of the caleche, I removed a few sentimental books Jackson liked, essential cookware, and sparse rations for the trek. The last thing I grabbed was my shotgun and a bit of ammo. \\n\\nAs we set from the dead place, the terrible silhouettes that were cut from there on the horizon behind us grew in my mind with every backward glance—I wanted to fall to pieces, but I saw Billy walk alongside me and although contented is not the right word, it is the nearest. The steps of our boots were all that was heard because I could not fathom to pierce the space between us with words for fear that it would all end. It was a dream, surely. I’d lost my mind. With my hands thumbed into the straps of my pack, I saw I my hands still shook, and they would shake a lot longer—years and with memories too. The crunch of earth underfoot became a rhythm and instead of looking at my brother, I watched his shadow on the ground.\\n\\n“Everyone’s dead?” He asked.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“You’re sure?”\\n\\n“Yeah,” I repeated.\\n\\n“How ain’t I? How ain’t you?”\\n\\nTo say that it was luck would’ve been too morbid. Instead of saying anything, I shrugged, kicked a loose stone, watched my feet some more, and felt a queasiness come over me. For the moment, the immeasurable deaths of those I’d left behind were forgotten in the company of my brother and a sickness welled up inside of me so suddenly that I felt that I’d fall to pieces at the slightest provocation. Finally, I did speak again, but only after steeling myself to the troubles, “Yeah, how are you alive?”\\n\\nBilly shrugged at me then stumbled up a hill which overlooked trash wood wilderness where sticks lay twisted and bare and further on the sight of Atlanta was visible and I cupped a hand across my brow and Billy did the same and we looked on at the shadows of the place out there where strings of smoke rose from the skyline as a signature for the desolation of the city; it was dead. I felt it in my bones.\\n\\nMy hands were light while my head was heavy, my throat was dry, and the entire world seized in moments of stillness or perhaps it was my own vision which construed the world in that way; I took to the small hill which Billy had climbed and sat there and stared at the place between my feet to steady myself.\\n\\n“Fire,” said Billy.\\n\\nI nodded and nearly choked.\\n\\nLeviathan—till then I had no belief in dragons—glided over the broken city, its winged shadow little seen but its voice was deep across the scene, letting go of roars which shook the ground. We hid among the trash wood and moved down the hill and watched the creature thrash in the air as if it was angry for its abominable life. Whatever millennia it spent in the pits of hell seemingly thrust upon it a love of destruction and pain.\\n\\nMy brother moved with a more assured stride and kept a cool distance and upon fleeing from the wreckage, from the outlying area of Atlanta and the place we’d left our family, he spoke little and watched me strangely whenever I took to melancholic fatiguing. We lit no fires for fear of what it could draw from the night so in the dark I’d see him watching some far-off place, maybe seeing through the reality which surrounded us, and he’d snap from it, catch my eye, and disappear for minutes to scan the perimeter of whatever place we stayed. Being alongside my resurrected brother was lonelier than I could bear, and I hoped he’d disappear for good or that I could work up the courage to end my own life. It was like purgatory explained in books and for a time, it felt endless; upon witnessing the destruction of Atlanta, we pushed to Marrietta, and it was much the same. As was Chatanooga, Nashville, Knoxville, Louisville, Charlotte. The ocean had risen so that Fayetville was gone underwater, and the Florida leg disappeared completely as far as I’m aware. I understood later that Memphis was overlooked and more places further west were alive too, but when we’d exhausted the south, we moved north and found strongholds of families or traders or even small groupings of civilization, but by and large we found nothing much in the two years that we hoofed it from place to place; it was my doing mostly—I wanted to find a place untouched by the mayhem in the area my family had once patrolled. \\n\\nIn retrospect, I am certain that Billy only stayed by my side for convenience; there wasn’t any of my brother left in the man that was my travelling companion for that time. He was a ghost of a person and Mephisto had preyed upon my desire in the worst moment of weakness in my life. There were nights—maybe we’d taken up in a natural alcove for shelter or we’d locked ourselves in some ancient structure for sleep—I’d watch Billy lay where he was, Sibylle’s hat and holster lying beside him, and I’d think of putting him down but he’d stir and in a brief shadow I’d see my brother as he’d been and withdraw to bury my face in fake sleep to be met with images of the night the demons attacked where I’d shake, sweat, and bite my lips so hard I’d drink blood.\\n\\nTwo years we marched around the Appalachians and in that time, I felt myself wither and disconnect.\\n\\nUpon moving further north we met Indianapolis—that’s what it was called back then—and it was run by an older woman called Lady Lazarus; I reckon her father, affluent and dead, was a fan of Plath. Indianapolis was fortified more than most with its high walls, and its wall men, and its underground facilities which produced substantial ammunition. We—me and Billy’s revenant—were travelling with a group of traders we’d taken up with from out west; they called themselves wizards and although they seemed of the occult, their spirits discounted whatever suspicions I might’ve had of them.\\n\\nI remember first pushing through that big gate; the town kept with it an indisputable malaise and though we were greeted at the gate by the leader Lady Lazarus—her brothers came along with her—and her jovial demeanor carried a certain infectious quality, I could not help but notice that the regular denizens maintained a healthy distance from their leader (the guards which followed the Lady everywhere probably had something to do with this). \\n\\nLady Lazarus touched each of our hands in greeting with enthusiasm and I could not help but notice how soft they were, how vibrant her eyes were, how much she smiled, and how beautiful she was given her age; already her head was fully gray.\\n\\nUpon meeting each of us, going through the wizard traders first, she came to me, and Billy and she shook my hand then pivoted to Billy.\\n\\n“Welcome. You can call me Lady.”\\n\\nBilly caught her hand in his, held it longer than she’d intended so that they held eye contact, and he smiled broadly, tipped the cowboy hat on his head back to expose his smooth forehead and said, “And you can call me Maron, mam. You are quite a sight for a tired man.”\\n\\nThough Maron—as he’d named himself—was more boy than man, Lady took a disturbed liking to him immediately and we prolonged our stay in Indianapolis after the wizards departed to head west.\\n\\nUnder the rule of Lady, Indianapolis was a theocracy, with her addressing the huddled masses at the steps of her grand abode, she’d preach for hours on sin and strife and quote her favorite passages; though reminiscent of my time with the Rednecks, I never found any truth or sincerity or freedom in her teaching—hers was more trouble, brimstone, fire and I’d had enough of that for a lifetime. Public execution was common. As was torture.\\n\\nMaron distanced himself further from me, but I remained to keep an eye on him—it was not sentimentality but rather I existed without purpose and conjured some from watching my brother.\\n\\nOften, Lady invited Maron to her private rooms and though the rumors and speculation ran the full spectrum of perverse speculation, every denizen feigned ignorance at her pregnancy.\\n\\nUpon giving birth, the infant was malformed with two heads—her brothers took this as an omen and killed the child, put their leader in the stocks for months, and stripped her of dignity while the denizens did to her what they pleased.\\n\\nMaron rose through the wall men while Lady’s brothers assumed control of Indianapolis and called themselves Bosses; in the time since Lady’s reign, the place was renamed to Golgotha for its closeness to a messiah.\\n\\nI went west but always found myself drawn back to Golgotha because of some emptiness in me. It was only with Suzanne that I wanted something more and knowing them, I almost believed in a world like the one that children dream about. The world that Gemma and Andrew chased after when they left home, like the one Aggie talked about in her mother’s books. There’s a hopelessness in me that I’ll never be rid of. In the interim between our initial arrival to Golgotha and that flight from that terrible city, I cannot know how many people I sacrificed in convening with demons because I refuse to know because the number would destroy me. That is the worst of it; I do not even have courage enough to face myself or the actions of my past in any substantive way.\\n\\nMephisto tainted me so that I could speak with his kind as a dealmaker and the disease grew.\\n\\nBilly or Maron or whatever he is should have been reaped long ago or better, I should never have brought that abomination alive. Such a cruel world where a deep longing like that can be inverted, weaponized. Me and him should both die; me and him should have died a long time ago. \\n\\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ha4beq/hiraeth_or_where_the_children_play/)/[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hiopez/hiraeth_or_where_the_children_play_hell_is/)', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 8}\n",

Not being a particularly beautiful place unlike its many neighbouring coastal towns, the town would slowly and silently decay. \\n\\nWhen the mines closed in the late 70s a man named Thomas Rowe would decide to start a shop from his front room using his handful of savings. His ever-dedicated wife, a woman by the name of Jenn, quit her job as a seamstress to work the shop for him and do all the bookkeeping. The two understood it would be a difficult journey ahead of them but they knew it was the kind of challenge that they wanted and were willing to work hard together. \\n\\nOver the next few hard-fought years, the two would build a successful store, fully converting the bottom floor of their home into the shop floor. Due to their willingness to lend a hand to anyone who needed it, the community around them looked after them in kind. “Tom & Jenn General” became a bastion of the community and a seemingly permanent fixture in the town.\\n\\nMy mum would tell me that even she and her friends called Jenn “Nana Jenn”, a name I’d known her as myself for as long as I can remember. She had a warmth about her, a soft welcoming smile that wrapped you in an all-encompassing warmth followed by a genuine interest in your day and maybe even a free sweet if we don’t tell Tom. Thomas Rowe was lovely but he was just Tom, only Jenn was Nana Jenn and everyone loved her for that.\\n\\nEven after his death the sign Tom put up all those years still hung, I must have been nine or ten when he passed. It was nice to see everyone come together to mourn with and take care of Nana Jenn, a community that over the years had become distant and fractured, joining forces to help this woman who had taken care of them for so long.\\n\\nAfter the shop was returned to its original state as a residential home, you would often see Nana Jenn wandering around town. Whether she was off to the dry cleaners or on her way to an appointment she would always have time to stop, chat and make sure you were doing okay. I swear to god even after that woman started losing her keys and jewellery she always seemed to remember everyone by name, at least until the events of our story.\\n\\nI was a young, brown-haired idiot when I turned 14, but that's okay because my best friend Jason was just the same, only his hair was shorter compared to my shoulder-length locks. We weren’t a pair of miscreants or anything but when you're a bored teen in the countryside there is a certain level of mischief that is entailed. The odd prank here or there, scrumping for apples and the odd bit of mild arson in some random field.\\n\\nOne time when playing a game where you knock on the door and run away before they catch you, Jason was able to sneak right up behind me and right as I knocked on the door he kicked me on my backside. Fully flat on the floor. Prone on my back.\\n\\nWith a deep sigh, I accepted my fate when I heard a soft melody coming from the doorway.\\n\\n“Oh! Mathew, what’s happened?”\\n\\nLooking up I see the slightly concerned face of Nana Jenn looking down at me quizzically.\\n\\n“So-sorry, I fell over when I uh, on the step.” I blurted out, scrambling to my feet to meet her at eye level.\\n\\n“You know, that little doorstep gets me too.” She chucked. “So what are you doing here, dear?”\\n\\n“Oh! I was just uh coming to check in on you.” I replied, unsure of how convincing my response was. “Just making sure you’re doing okay or if you need help with anything?”\\n\\n“Well sweetheart, it’s funny you should mention because just today I lost my special necklace that Tom got me.” \\n\\n“Well, where do you last remember having it?” Came the approaching voice of Jason, who had clearly come back after I didn’t come running behind him.\\n\\n“Hello Jason, well… I had it at the butchers, but then I didn’t have it by the time I got home and I didn’t stop anywhere between the two. I had a little look but my eyes aren't what they used to be.”\\n\\n“We’re not doing anything so we could look, it’s the summer holidays so we have the time,” I explained smiling at the ever more frail seeming Nana Jenn. \\n\\n“You know the necklace I’m talking about right?” She asked.\\n\\n“Yeah of course we do,” I replied, and honestly we did. \\n\\nThe necklace she was referring to was as permanent a fixture as she was. A stunning tin necklace whose tarnish didn’t distract from the intricate beauty of the etching of a Celtic cross behind a large cat. I often worried about her spine due to the size of the necklace, however, she always seemed to be so used to it that it was more natural to compensate for the weight of the charm than not.\\n\\nWith that Jason and I had become the initial search team for Nana Jenns' necklace, it wasn’t long until we were able to rope others into it as we asked anyone we saw along our search path. In no time what felt like half the town was now either actively or passively on the hunt for her pendant.\\n\\nMaybe it was guilt for not finding it, but Jason and I became regulars at Nana Jenn's home, she always seemed happy to see us and honestly, we both kinda enjoyed spending the time with her. We’d often do little chores for her, help her carry things around and always be willing to taste-test her wonderful pastries.\\n\\nNana Jenn one afternoon told us the story of her necklace. It was given to her by Sam when he received a large raise at work all the wives of the miners here had been given one. She had loved it so much and taken care of it for so long, Jenn was the last person alive who had received one but after this many years that was to be expected.\\n\\nSlowly but all of a sudden Nana Jenn started to go downhill. Little things were forgotten here or there, less energy to do what she loved and even her eyes had become slowly more sunken into her skull. She was aging before our very eyes, decaying and before long it would be my family who would offer to take care of her. With all the time I had spent with her my mom and dad had bonded with her as much as I had, so when they noticed how bad she had gotten, our home became the obvious choice to take care of her considering her lack of remaining family.\\n\\n“So my bed is here?” Breathed a slightly confused but ever considerate Nana Jenn.\\n\\n“Yes Jenn, we have put a new bed with a new mattress, especially for you. We’ve even got a load of your stuff from your room to make it feel like home.” My mom had always been a kind woman, heavily influenced by Nana Jenn and her own mother.\\n\\n“Steff, you’ve been too good to me.” A tear appeared in Jenn's eyes as she hugged my mom, her Ginger hair getting tangled in Jenn’s face.\\n\\n“You’ve looked after me and this family for so long, we’re just happy that we have the opportunity to pay it back.” Reasoned Steff, who herself was now fighting back the tears.\\n\\nNana Jenn settled in quickly, however, it would not be long until we noticed something strange. Both my dad and I had separately heard a soft rhythmic whispering coming from her room late at night, upon investigation it would seem that she was asleep both times. One night I heard her just muttering; “They need it. They need to be buried with it. With it. It's not good. Not. Not good.”\\n\\nThese small creepy yet explainable instances got overshadowed by the chaotic trial of the festive season. For just the month of December we had hired a nurse to take care of her simple needs so we didn’t have to worry, my parents could take me and my sister out for festive activities without having to worry about Jenn. The nurse would be a good choice too as we found out that this would probably be the last Christmas for our Great Aunt Sophie, so from Christmas to New Year we would be staying with her immediate family up country. \\n\\nThe day we were due back the nurse had stopped taking our calls. At best when we would call the house all we got was a confused Nana Jenn who by this point, was beginning to degrade to such a point that she had no idea where the nurse was, or even if she had seen the nurse at all recently. Hurrying home, all we could find upon returning was the nurse's handbag with her phone, wallet and keys all missing. Nana Jenn was sitting there on her bed, silently drinking tea and staring at TV static, her warm smile plastered blankly across her face.\\n\\nMom and Dad would take turns looking after her while I took care of a lot of the household chores, seeing how hard they had it with her I didn’t mind taking the lion's share of the chores. I didn’t even mind the continued whispering all that much, you’d be surprised how quickly the creepy can become banal, just part of the background noise of an ever more complex life.\\n\\nLying in bed one night I heard the door creaking open right as I was right at the precipice of sleep, forcing me awake with a jolt. I looked around to confirm my dream-fed paranoia that something beyond a nightmare had made its way in. There was nothing, even when I turned my lamp on. Nothing at all was in my room and I could go back to sleep. I turned the lamp off and resumed my former position, comfortable once again under the sheets.\\n\\nAn undetermined amount of time later it happened again. A loud creak echoed into my bedroom. Turning my head to look at the doorway to my bedroom, I saw it was in the same position as it was before. Had I imagined it? A loud snoring came rumbling through the house, a comforting reminder that my parents were just feet away. \\n\\nEyes open, face to the door and meditating on the muddled roar emanating from the hall, I suddenly hear a new sound. A fast rhythmic white noise. Breathing. Breathing coming from somewhere nearby. Then I heard it, eyes focused on the static door I heard a creak.\\n\\nThere was only one other place that could have been. Turning on my lamp I returned to my original orientation facing the wardrobe.\\n\\nIt was Jenn, inside the wardrobe, her flower-embossed nightgown covering much of the gap in the wardrobe door. At the top her face, one eye poking through the crack and a familiar soft smile across her face. The most disturbing part was her fast and almost rhythmic breathing like she was excited.\\n\\nAfraid to break eye contact I called out to my parents, unmoving and afraid to move, afraid to even blink.\\n\\nMy father came in like a shot and quickly escorted a very confused woman back to her bed. It was strange however, the moment my father entered the room she stopped smiling and began to breathe at a regular pace.\\n\\nI didn’t sleep well that night. I didn’t have a good night's sleep for a long time. The image of her dull sunken eyes, excitedly making direct eye contact with me would singe itself into my mind anytime the lights would go out.\\n\\nShortly after that night, my sister would begin complaining of an awful smell. Her room being the one directly above Nana Jenn it was suspected that the smell from Jenn's room rising up through the floor was the cause. It didn’t matter what we did however, no amount of popery or air fresheners would cover that awful smell. Even after aggressive attacks from gallons of febreeze and enough dented powers to solve any infestation, a week later the smell returned just as rancid as before. Maybe we should have been more thorough in our investigation of the smell, but my sister was leaving very soon for university so it wasn’t the highest priority after a while.\\n\\nNana Jenn just got worse from there. She kept staring at the ceiling in her room, just sitting there and smiling at nothing. We’d occasionally find her in places, like the attic or a storage cupboard, just looking at us as she smiled a blank artifice of her former caring expression. She grew ever gaunt and frail looking, however, the way she moved so confidently was so disjointed from her skeletal frame. Her skin had sunk so low it was almost separate from any sort of bone structure underneath.\\n\\nWhen my great-aunt died it caused a lot more drama in the immediate family than expected, so mum and dad had to go pretty much immediately. They managed to find a nurse to look after Nana Jenn again after vetting this one with much more scrutiny, she even agreed to keep an eye out on me and make sure I don’t burn anything down in the house while cooking or anything.\\n\\nMaja was nice, I know that’s not a very creative description but it fit who she was. I couldn’t tell you where she was from but she was just the right mix of both professional and understanding of the fact that I was a young teenage boy left to his own devices. She cooked Kopytka a few times to make sure I had a few vegetables. I know it had potato in it and tasted great but again, couldn’t tell you the origins of the dish. \\n\\n“Little kochanie, what is wrong with her exactly?” Maja asked while I was sitting on the sofa watching TV one evening.\\n\\n“We’re not sure. Honestly, the doctors aren’t sure either. It’s kinda like a degenerative brain thing they were saying but it’s not exactly like dementia.” I explained to the best of my capability.\\n\\n“Hmm, that is pretty much what your mother told me.” She retorted, looking off into the distance a little.\\n\\n“How come? Like what brought this on?” I asked.\\n\\n“She just.” Maja pauses to take a deep breath. “Your grandmother is saying things… like. Wrong things.”\\n\\n“Wrong things?” I parroted.\\n\\n“Things like, about a man who lives in the room with her, a man who is angry with her.” I could see the deep concern on her face.\\n\\n“Yeah… I’ve heard stuff like that from her but I guess she’s just getting worse lately.” I reassured her. “She never does anything but stare and smile though, I wouldn’t worry. I know it’s creepy though.”\\n\\nMaja smiled at me attempting to show she was reassured, and messed my hair up before then returning to Nana Jenn's room.\\n\\nIt was a few days later when I heard her frantically knocking at my bedroom door. Still paranoid and vigilant at night I woke up quickly and cautiously announced the visitor in. Maja burst into the room, panic clear in her face, barely able to get a word out. I quickly noticed her hands were covered in blood.\\n\\n“I have to go, I saw him here.” This was all I could get out of her before a figure blocked out the incoming light from the hallway.\\n\\nTaking both of our attention immediately, we saw Nana Jenn standing just beyond the threshold of the doorway. Maja screamed a bloodcurdling scream before suddenly and without any warning jumping out of my bedroom window. \\n\\nI sat there in shock staring at the broken window as Jenn shuffled away, restoring light to the room.\\n\\nA police investigation had, from what I could gather through eavesdropping, discovered that she had a history of bipolar disorder and had divorced her husband about 6 months before her suicide, just confirming the narrative they already assumed.\\n\\nI became obsessed. Jason had noticed the level of obsession that had taken me. He even asked about everything one day and I broke, I cried even. I split everything, what had happened, what I was feeling and most importantly my theories about what was happening. On those theories, nothing was a solid hypothesis but rather I knew something was happening and it was Nana Jenn at the root of it all.\\n\\nJason and I made plans to have him stay over that weekend, something that had become rare since Nana Jenn had moved in but with my parents spending one night away for their anniversary it was the perfect time. We were going to stay up late and sneak down and see what was happening in Jenn's room at night, and what was going on with the whispering.\\n\\n“Dude, if you scare me on purpose I will kick you so hard in the nuts,” Jason warned me in a whisper as he descended the stairs late that Saturday night. \\n\\n“I promise you, if anything is gonna scare you it’s gonna be her,” I replied, eyes fixed on the bottom of the stairs.\\n\\n“Well okay, I still don’t like that I’m going first. It’s your creepy ass house.” With that a resigned Jason tentatively made his way down the stairs, reacting to every creak and groan from the floorboards.\\n\\nAs we turned the corner we immediately heard the whispering, a soft raspy chant emanating from the place we knew Nana Jenn resided. Jason took a deep breath before quietly knocking on her door. I shot Jason a quizzically angry look, to which he just shrugged before unconfidently gripping the handle. With a nod to me, Jason opened the door.\\n\\nWhat hit us first was the stench, an expression mirroring my disgust was plastered across Jason's face as soon as the door opened. Then we saw her. Nana Jenn stood in the centre of the room, her clothing on the floor and the nude skin that was so usually covered in her gown was a mass of decaying and rotting flesh. She panted as she smiled towards the ceiling once again.\\n\\nA dissociative free fall took hold, almost like my brain was trying to protect me by making everything feel like a dream like it couldn’t be real. I didn’t even notice that Jason was screaming. I just saw her. \\n\\nBy the time I had regained control over my senses, I noticed two screams in unison. One was Jason screaming in an all-encompassing terror, and the second was Jenn, who was now on top of Jason, her thumbs buried deep into his eye sockets as she screamed into his face. \\n\\nBlustering all my strength I kicked the thing that was Jenn off of Jason, injuring my ankle as I did so with a dissatisfying crunch. Even through my pain I still saw her thumbs leave Jason’s eyes with a sickening squelch as she tumbled a meter or so away.\\n\\nI wrenched a whimpering Jason up and began practically dragging him out of that room and out the front door. Closing the door behind me I continued to drag Jason away, to somewhere, to the family next door, they owned guns and I knew we’d be safe. In tears, I pulled Jason the 400 meters or so to the next door and began banging on the door as hard as I could.\\n\\nJason is alive. Blind and sour about it, but alive. As for Jenn, she went missing immediately after. It would be another year of sleepless nights before she was found dead and naked in the local forest by an old Celtic shrine. The worst part was what we found when she left. After investigating the ever-present smell and pulling up the floorboards in my sister's old bedroom we found her. Jenn had killed the first nurse, ripped her eyes out pulled out her throat then hidden her in the floors.\\n\\nThere was plenty of shock and sorrow in the community at the news of their former matriarch but those feelings were all temporary and soon faded with time, now all the town is left with is the eerie tale of an old woman with no skin who haunts an old pile of stones out on the moors.\\n\", 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 34}\n",

Why is there such darkness in space? Why does the vast expanse of space feel so cold, so empty, so desolate?\\n\\nThroughout history, brilliant minds have wielded science and mathematics to unravel the mysteries of space and time. But did anyone answer why? Why is it that the speed of light is limited while distances of cosmic objects are so huge? Why is space so empty and dead? Why are the only examples of life we know exist on a single planet orbiting a single star?\\n\\nThere’s a harsh truth we often forget: we are small, limited creatures. We perceive only three spatial dimensions and experience time as a single, unbroken thread. What if beyond our senses or understanding, lies a reality so alien that it eludes even the sharpest minds?\\n\\nI am an astrophysicist and it was my life\\'s work to figure out these questions. Questions rarely pondered in today\\'s world. What I dicovered was a terrible truth about the nature of our universe. It would have been the most earth shattering discovery, had the world\\'s governments not suppressed it. \\n\\nSurely, you must observed how things have changed over the last few decades. The way governments have stopped planning for the future, the way corporations are hoarding resources like there’s no tomorrow. It’s not just greed. They know.\\n\\nI don’t think staying silent is an option anymore. People deserve to know. Even if the truth breaks them. If this post disappears, or if I do, you’ll understand why.\\n\\nIt started soon after the Apollo Lunar missions. Space exploration was at it peak and we had mountains of data to process. As we studied the data, we noticed anomalies in the light\\'s temperature fluctuations. Subtle but consistent deviations that suggested something odd about the way light had traveled in the early universe. Further analysis revealed that these fluctuations couldn’t be explained by known physical models. Einstein was completely wrong. We had evidence that the speed of light was not a constant. In fact, in the early universe, it was almost infinite, but had slowed down to the value we observe today.\\n\\nLeading physicists dismissed our findings as speculative nonsense. They claimed our methodology was flawed. The heart of the controversy lay in the implications of our work. If light had indeed slowed down, it undermined one of the most important constants in physics. The speed of light wasn’t just a number, it was a cornerstone of modern science. To question it was to question the very structure of the universe. The US govenment played a significant role in suppressing our work as it undermined the careers of a lot of very prominent and well paid scientists.\\n\\nI still continued my work in obscurity. My reputation was tarnished beyond repair but I refused to give up.\\n\\nSee, If the speed of light had slowed, it raised a haunting question: why?\\n\\nPhysics offers no mechanism for such a change. Constants, by their very nature, are supposed to be unchanging. A changing speed of light implied an external force, something beyond our understanding of the universe. It suggested interference, not just with light, but with the fundamental laws of reality.\\n\\nAnd if that interference was deliberate... who, or what, was responsible? This was what made even the bravest physicists uncomfortable.\\n\\nAs technology advanced, more scientists joined me as they independently figured out the truth and were subsequently ridiculed and supressed. In hindsight, perhaps they were justified in their efforts to silence us. Even now, I can\\'t help but regret that we ever dared to seek the answer to the question of \"Why?\"\\n\\nIt all started with something we found in the early 2000s. Infrared surveys of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the faint radiation left over from the Big Bang, found something we didn’t expect.\\n\\nThere was a strange glow superimposed on the CMB. It was faint, like static, but it was structured. At first, we thought it might be a calibration error or interference. But the glow was real, and when we mapped it out, it formed patterns.\\n\\nNot random patterns. Complex ones.\\n\\nIt was like finding fingerprints in the oldest layers of the universe.\\n\\nWhen we looked closer at the data, we found something horrifying.\\n\\nThe universe was once a vibrant, radiant expanse, teeming with light and life far beyond what we can comprehend today. The cosmos wasn’t always the cold, empty void we see now; it was filled with energy, potential, and life in a way that we could scarcely imagine. But then something changed. Something began to drain it, changing the constants of reality. A force or an entity perhaps, not of this dimension, slowly siphoned off the universe\\'s vitality, consuming energy, and leaving behind the desolate expanse we now call space. And perhaps most terrifying of all, this force or entity, whatever it is, isn’t gone.\\n\\nYou’ve probably heard of the Bootes Void. It’s a massive region of space with almost no galaxies in it, so empty that it makes everything around it seem unnaturally dense. Astronomers have always thought it was just a natural phenomenon, the result of random fluctuations in the universe’s early expansion. But we studied it meticulously. That was our evidence that the force or entity is still out there, snuffing out galaxies and stars at a phenomenal scale. Based on our calculations, we have tragically very little time left. Maybe in a day or maybe in a thousand years, we will certainly be wiped from existence, consumed by forces beyond our comprehension.\\n\\nWe are not drifting in an endless sea, but trapped in a cold, dark prison with its walls closing in every second. The Fermi Paradox, the question of why we haven’t found alien life was never a paradox. We haven’t found life because we’re the last ones left. The final embers of life in a universe that’s already gone dark.\\n\\nThere is nothing we can do to stop this. We are like insects trying to stop an earthquake. Our leaders know the truth. That’s why progress has stalled. That’s why governments have abandoned their dreams of the stars. They’re preparing for the end, even if they won’t admit it.\\n\\nSo, the next time you look up at the night sky, remember this: the silence you see is not natural. It is deliberate, a haunting stillness that echoes the universe’s slow death. And soon, we will all fall into that same silence, forgotten, like the stars themselves.', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 89}\n",

And yes, it\\'s a unicorn. \\n\\nAbout three weeks ago, there were several murders around the Cedar Grove Forest Reserve, and witnesses and authorities believed it to be a wild animal. By the third or fourth kill, the county sheriff and the conservation department searched the forest for the animal. On the search, two conservation officers were killed, and a deputy saw the whole thing, claiming it to be a unicorn. \\n\\nWe all thought the deputy was too shaken by the whole ordeal, but he kept warning everyone to stay away from the forest, otherwise the unicorn would kill them if it was seen. He was put on suspension by his supervisor, but he even posted on this site, warning everyone of the killer unicorn in the forest.\\n\\nTwo days ago, a patient came in with a massive stab wound in their stomach. They were cutting down a tree near the Reserve and they saw an animal that attacked and nearly killed them. He managed to crawl into his truck and drive himself to the hospital as the creature ran back into the woods. When asked what animal it was, all he said was, \"unicorn.\"\\n\\nWe had the patient stay the night, having given him some strong pain medication that made him a little loopy. \\n\\nAround midnight, I was in my office, finishing some reports, when I saw the patient frantically crawling down the hallway. I went to check on him, and he screamed, \"LOOK AWAY! DON\\'T LOOK!\" \\n\\nThe lights proceeded to go off, and light footsteps sounded from down the hall. The emergency lights kicked on, dimly revealing the silhouette of a horse-like creature. A unicorn. \\n\\nI tried to help the patient escape and awkwardly grabbed him but the arms, but he pushed me down and put a hand over my eyes. \"DON\\'T LOOK!\" He kept yelling. Suddenly, his words became a scream of pain as he was dragged away by the unicorn. I heard a shriek of tremendous pain and sounds of blood before it was all over, and the lights returned to normal. \\n\\nI looked up to see the man\\'s body, with an expression where you know it was the worst pain he ever felt. \\n\\nThe Sheriff\\'s Office was called, and I was questioned for the whole ordeal. I told them that an animal had broken into the hospital and killed the patient. They questioned other patients and staff and never saw the animal, but they did hear it right after the lights went out.\\n\\nThe cops checked the security footage and saw the patient being dragged and killed by a seemingly invisible creature. After that, they had us take off and the patients relocated to different hospitals. Still, The hospital is closed down, and I doubt it\\'ll reopen anytime soon.\\n\\nAnyway, I got on social media and reached out to the deputy who claimed he saw the unicorn. We talked over Facebook, and he said that it doesn\\'t like to be seen, yet he saw it and it didn\\'t kill him. However, since the unicorn came to the hospital to kill the patient, it could be coming for him next.\\n\\nThe deputy said he was hiding in his basement until he KNEW the unicorn wasn\\'t coming for him. Which was smart, because the next day, or yesterday, a little girl was found dead in her backyard, with a massive stab wound in her stomach. \\n\\nThen yesterday afternoon, two men in suits came to my house. They liked like either the FBI or CIA, and they asked me several questions regarding my incident and if I ever saw the unicorn, to which I said I only saw its silhouette ---which they didn\\'t seem to like. \\n\\nThey told me to stay indoors for a few days, and that a man who be stationed outside my house for my \"personal security.\" \\n\\nToday, the man is still outside, and as far as I know, the creature is still at large. I post this to warn everyone in or outside Cedar Grove about this thing. If you ever find it and see it clearly, pray. \\n\\n', 'comments': 'koi', 'upvotes': 5}\n"
